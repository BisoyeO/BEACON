http://futurism.com/three-main-pieces-of-evidence-supporting-evolution/,1,"For over 150 years – since the time of Charles Darwin – the theory of evolution has been through more scrutiny and rigorous investigation than just about any other scientific claim. Since that time, the theory of evolution has only been strengthened as more evidence has been accrued. While there are many that, for ideological reasons, want to make it seem like evolution is not widely accepted within the scientific community, this is not actually the case. Across universities, research institutions, and scientific organizations, evolution is not only nearly universally accepted, it is also the basis upon which active, exciting, and important research is being done. The overall goal of this post is to point out the patterns of evolution within nature and help individuals identify other, similar patterns on their own. Doing so will give you the power to, in a sense, test the validity of evolution on your own. Like in a court of law, you have the ability to weigh the evidence in support and against evolution to come to your own conclusion that, in legalese, is “beyond a reasonable doubt”. This list of the “Three Main Pieces of Evidence Supporting Evolution” will read a bit different from other lists. It is not meant to be just a “gotcha!” list of examples that support evolution. The goal is much loftier—to give a complete overview of the most direct evidence in support of evolution. The examples that will be provided are meant to be illustrative in addition to exemplary. Without further ado, the big 3: 1) SPECIES SHARE SIMILARITIES THAT ARE SIGNS OF THEIR COMMON ANCESTRY."
http://futurism.com/three-main-pieces-of-evidence-supporting-evolution/,1,"Think about your family. You and your closest relatives look more alike than you do compared to your cousins. Likewise, you look more like your cousins than you do compared to some distant relative, a stranger, or a person on the other side of the globe. The closer you are related, by-and-large, the more similarities you share. These similarities extend well beyond the surface level and, of course, also reach into genetic and geographic similarities. Sinauer Associates, Inc. (Image source: Sinauer Associates, Inc.) This patterning, like in your family, extends throughout life on Earth. How can we be sure, though, that they aren’t just “common design by a common designer”? It’s the patterning of the similarities that speaks volumes. Similarities (synapomorphies) between species come in nested hierarchies. Meaning, the more similarities you have, the greater in variety and intensity are the similarities shared. Why is this the case? Because the similarities have been inherited from common ancestors and the further back in time any two species shared a common ancestor, the more faded and distant the similarities become. Furthermore, species with a large number of similarities also tend to live near each other—penguin species only live in the Southern Hemisphere, marsupials live almost exclusively in Australia, cacti almost exclusively in the Americas, lemurs in Madagascar, etc. If evolution is not true, this geographic patterning would make absolutely no sense. Furthermore, these similarities often seem to be completely arbitrary, rather than having some selective advantage."

There are likely several hundred thousand insect species and they all have pretty much the same body plan. Coincidence? I think not! (source)Insects, though unbelievably diverse, have 6 legs. There are likely several hundred thousand insect species and they all have pretty much the same body plan. (Image source: “User:Fir0002”, via Wikimedia Commons)2) THERE ARE PROGRESSIONS OF SPECIES CHANGING OVER TIME.One of the most  important discoveries that lead up to Darwin’s theory of evolution was extinct animals found as fossils.  Early paleontologists like Charles Lyell and George Cuvier noticed a very simple fact—species that lived in the past are very often drastically, wildly different from anything alive today. Trilobites, dinosaurs, giant sloths, baculites, etc. suggest that life on Earth has changed quite a bit. That would be interesting enough on its own. What makes it more interesting is that the further back one goes, the more different the species appear when compared to today’s. These overarching trends can also be seen on the individual level as lineages can be seen changing over time.How do we know, though, that fossil progressions don’t just represent separate, unrelated species?  First, they have similarities that suggest they are related (see above reasoning concerning similarities between species). Secondly, they represent a trend or progression of change. "
http://futurism.com/three-main-pieces-of-evidence-supporting-evolution/,1,"For instance, over time the species go from low expression of a certain trait to intermediate expression to high expression. Lastly, the fossils are dated and organized by direct means (like radiometric dating) or indirect means (like relative dating using unique marker layers, fossils, or other techniques).EXAMPLE FOSSILS:(source)Human evolution.

Like those tags, species bear the marks of where they came from. These signs of origin might come in the form of repurposed traits, traits that hurt a species chances of surviving or reproducing, or the lack of sensible traits. Put simply, species are flawed and it’s these flaws that clearly tell of their natural origin."
http://www.icr.org/home/resources/resources_tracts_scientificcaseagainstevolution/,0,"Belief in evolution is a remarkable phenomenon. It is a belief passionately defended by the scientific establishment, despite the lack of any observable scientific evidence for macroevolution (that is, evolution from one distinct kind of organism into another). This odd situation is briefly documented here by citing recent statements from leading evolutionists admitting their lack of proof. These statements inadvertently show that evolution on any significant scale does not occur at present, and never happened in the past, and could never happen at all. Evolution Is Not Happening Now First of all, the lack of a case for evolution is clear from the fact that no one has ever seen it happen. If it were a real process, evolution should still be occurring, and there should be many ""transitional"" forms that we could observe. What we see instead, of course, is an array of distinct ""kinds"" of plants and animals with many varieties within each kind, but with very clear and -- apparently -- unbridgeable gaps between the kinds. That is, for example, there are many varieties of dogs and many varieties of cats, but no ""dats"" or ""cogs."" Such variation is often called microevolution, and these minor horizontal (or downward) changes occur fairly often, but such changes are not true ""vertical"" evolution. Evolutionary geneticists have often experimented on fruit flies and other rapidly reproducing species to induce mutational changes hoping they would lead to new and better species, but these have all failed to accomplish their goal. No truly new species has ever been produced, let alone a new ""basic kind."" A current leading evolutionist, Jeffrey Schwartz, professor of anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh, has recently acknowledged that: . . . it was and still is the case that, with the exception of Dobzhansky's claim about a new species of fruit fly, the formation of a new species, by any mechanism, has never been observed.1 The scientific method traditionally has required experimental observation and replication. The fact that macroevolution (as distinct from microevolution) has never been observed would seem to exclude it from the domain of true science. Even Ernst Mayr, the dean of living evolutionists, longtime professor of biology at Harvard, who has alleged that evolution is a ""simple fact,"" nevertheless agrees that it is an ""historical science"" for which ""laws and experiments are inappropriate techniques""2 by which to explain it. One can never actually see evolution in action. Evolution Never Happened in the Past Evolutionists commonly answer the above criticism by claiming that evolution goes too slowly for us to see it happening today. They used to claim that the real evidence for evolution was in the fossil record of the past, but the fact is that the billions of known fossils do not include a single unequivocal transitional form with transitional structures in the process of evolving. Given that evolution, according to Darwin, was in a continual state of motion . . . it followed logically that the fossil record should be rife with examples of transitional forms leading from the less to the more evolved.3 Even those who believe in rapid evolution recognize that a considerable number of generations would be required for one distinct ""kind"" to evolve into another more complex kind. There ought, therefore, to be a considerable number of true transitional structures preserved in the fossils -- after all, there are billions of non-transitional structures there! But (with the exception of a few very doubtful creatures such as the controversial feathered dinosaurs and the alleged walking whales), they are not there. Instead of filling in the gaps in the fossil record with so-called missing links, most paleontologists found themselves facing a situation in which there were only gaps in the fossil record, with no evidence of transformational intermediates between documented fossil species.4 The entire history of evolution from the evolution of life from non-life to the evolution of vertebrates from invertebrates to the evolution of man from the ape is strikingly devoid of intermediates: the links are all missing in the fossil record, just as they are in the present world. With respect to the origin of life, a leading researcher in this field, Leslie Orgel, after noting that neither proteins nor nucleic acids could have arisen without the other, concludes: And so, at first glance, one might have to conclude that life could never, in fact, have originated by chemical means.5 Being committed to total evolution as he is, Dr. Orgel cannot accept any such conclusion as that. Therefore, he speculates that RNA may have come first, but then he still has to admit that: The precise events giving rise to the RNA world remain unclear. . . . investigators have proposed many hypotheses, but evidence in favor of each of them is fragmentary at best.6 Translation: ""There is no known way by which life could have arisen naturalistically."" Unfortunately, two generations of students have been taught that Stanley Miller's famous experiment on a gaseous mixture, practically proved the naturalistic origin of life. But not so! Miller put the whole thing in a ball, gave it an electric charge, and waited. He found that amino acids and other fundamental complex molecules were accumulating at the bottom of the apparatus. His discovery gave a huge boost to the scientific investigation of the origin of life. Indeed, for some time it seemed like creation of life in a test tube was within reach of experimental science. Unfortunately, such experiments have not progressed much further than the original prototype, leaving us with a sour aftertaste from the primordial soup.7 Neither is there any clue as to how the one-celled organisms of the primordial world could have evolved into the vast array of complex multi-celled invertebrates of the Cambrian period. Even dogmatic evolutionist Gould admits that: The Cambrian explosion was the most remarkable and puzzling event in the history of life.8 Equally puzzling, however, is how some invertebrate creature in the ancient ocean, with all its ""hard parts"" on the outside, managed to evolve into the first vertebrate -- that is, the first fish-- with its hard parts all on the inside. Yet the transition from spineless invertebrates to the first backboned fishes is still shrouded in mystery, and many theories abound.9 Other gaps are abundant, with no real transitional series anywhere. A very bitter opponent of creation science, paleontologist, Niles Eldredge, has acknowledged that there is little, if any, evidence of evolutionary transitions in the fossil record. Instead, things remain the same!"
http://www.icr.org/home/resources/resources_tracts_scientificcaseagainstevolution/,0,"It is a simple ineluctable truth that virtually all members of a biota remain basically stable, with minor fluctuations, throughout their durations. . . .10 So how do evolutionists arrive at their evolutionary trees from fossils of oganisms which didn't change during their durations? Fossil discoveries can muddle over attempts to construct simple evolutionary trees -- fossils from key periods are often not intermediates, but rather hodge podges of defining features of many different groups. . . . Generally, it seems that major groups are not assembled in a simple linear or progressive manner -- new features are often ""cut and pasted"" on different groups at different times.11 As far as ape/human intermediates are concerned, the same is true, although anthropologists have been eagerly searching for them for many years. Many have been proposed, but each has been rejected in turn. All that paleoanthropologists have to show for more than 100 years of digging are remains from fewer than 2000 of our ancestors. They have used this assortment of jawbones, teeth and fossilized scraps, together with molecular evidence from living species, to piece together a line of human descent going back 5 to 8 million years to the time when humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancestor.12 Anthropologists supplemented their extremely fragmentary fossil evidence with DNA and other types of molecular genetic evidence from living animals to try to work out an evolutionary scenario that will fit. But this genetic evidence really doesn't help much either, for it contradicts fossil evidence. Lewin notes that: The overall effect is that molecular phylogenetics is by no means as straightforward as its pioneers believed. . . . The Byzantine dynamics of genome change has many other consequences for molecular phylogenetics, including the fact that different genes tell different stories.13 Summarizing the genetic data from humans, another author concludes, rather pessimistically: Even with DNA sequence data, we have no direct access to the processes of evolution, so objective reconstruction of the vanished past can be achieved only by creative imagination.14 Since there is no real scientific evidence that evolution is occurring at present or ever occurred in the past, it is reasonable to conclude that evolution is not a fact of science, as many claim. In fact, it is not even science at all, but an arbitrary system built upon faith in universal naturalism. Actually, these negative evidences against evolution are, at the same time, strong positive evidences for special creation. They are, in fact, specific predictions based on the creation model of origins. Creationists would obviously predict ubiquitous gaps between created kinds, though with many varieties capable of arising within each kind, in order to enable each basic kind to cope with changing environments without becoming extinct. Creationists also would anticipate that any ""vertical changes"" in organized complexity would be downward, since the Creator (by definition) would create things correctly to begin with. Thus, arguments and evidences against evolution are, at the same time, positive evidences for creation. The Equivocal Evidence from Genetics Nevertheless, because of the lack of any direct evidence for evolution, evolutionists are increasingly turning to dubious circumstantial evidences, such as similarities in DNA or other biochemical components of organisms as their ""proof"" that evolution is a scientific fact. A number of evolutionists have even argued that DNA itself is evidence for evolution since it is common to all organisms. More often is the argument used that similar DNA structures in two different organisms proves common evolutionary ancestry. Neither argument is valid. There is no reason whatever why the Creator could not or would not use the same type of genetic code based on DNA for all His created life forms. This is evidence for intelligent design and creation, not evolution. The most frequently cited example of DNA commonality is the human/chimpanzee ""similarity,"" noting that chimpanzees have more than 90% of their DNA the same as humans. This is hardly surprising, however, considering the many physiological resemblances between people and chimpanzees. Why shouldn't they have similar DNA structures in comparison, say, to the DNA differences between men and spiders? Similarities -- whether of DNA, anatomy, embryonic development, or anything else -- are better explained in terms of creation by a common Designer than by evolutionary relationship. The great differences between organisms are of greater significance than the similarities, and evolutionism has no explanation for these if they all are assumed to have had the same ancestor. How could these great gaps between kinds ever arise at all, by any natural process? The apparently small differences between human and chimpanzee DNA obviously produce very great differences in their respective anatomies, intelligence, etc. The superficial similarities between all apes and human beings are nothing compared to the differences in any practical or observable sense. Nevertheless, evolutionists, having largely become disenchanted with the fossil record as a witness for evolution because of the ubiquitous gaps where there should be transitions, recently have been promoting DNA and other genetic evidence as proof of evolution. However, as noted above by Roger Lewin, this is often inconsistent with, not only the fossil record, but also with the comparative morphology of the creatures. Lewin also mentions just a few typical contradictions yielded by this type of evidence in relation to more traditional Darwinian ""proofs."" The elephant shrew, consigned by traditional analysis to the order insectivores . . . is in fact more closely related to . . . the true elephant. Cows are more closely related to dolphins than they are to horses. The duckbilled platypus . . . is on equal evolutionary footing with . . . kangaroos and koalas.15 There are many even more bizarre comparisons yielded by this approach. The abundance of so-called ""junk DNA"" in the genetic code also has been offered as a special type of evidence for evolution, especially those genes which they think have experienced mutations, sometimes called ""pseudogenes.""16 However, evidence is accumulating rapidly today that these supposedly useless genes do actually perform useful functions. Enough genes have already been uncovered in the genetic midden to show that what was once thought to be waste is definitely being transmitted into scientific code.17"
http://www.icr.org/home/resources/resources_tracts_scientificcaseagainstevolution/,0,"It is thus wrong to decide that junk DNA, even the socalled ""pseudogenes,"" have no function. That is merely an admission of ignorance and an object for fruitful research. Like the socalled ""vestigial organs"" in man, once considered as evidence of evolution but now all known to have specific uses, so the junk DNA and pseudogenes most probably are specifically useful to the organism, whether or not those uses have yet been discovered by scientists. At the very best this type of evidence is strictly circumstantial and can be explained just as well in terms of primeval creation supplemented in some cases by later deterioration, just as expected in the creation model. The real issue is, as noted before, whether there is any observable evidence that evolution is occurring now or has ever occurred in the past. As we have seen, even evolutionists have to acknowledge that this type of real scientific evidence for evolution does not exist. A good question to ask is: Why are all observable evolutionary changes either horizontal and trivial (so-called microevolution) or downward toward deterioration and extinction? The answer seems to be found in the universally applicable laws of the science of thermodynamics. Evolution Could Never Happen at All The main scientific reason why there is no evidence for evolution in either the present or the past (except in the creative imagination of evolutionary scientists) is because one of the most fundamental laws of nature precludes it. The law of increasing entropy -- also known as the second law of thermodynamics -- stipulates that all systems in the real world tend to go ""downhill,"" as it were, toward disorganization and decreased complexity. This law of entropy is, by any measure, one of the most universal, bestproved laws of nature. It applies not only in physical and chemical systems, but also in biological and geological systems -- in fact, in all systems, without exception. No exception to the second law of thermodynamics has ever been found -- not even a tiny one. Like conservation of energy (the ""first law""), the existence of a law so precise and so independent of details of models must have a logical foundation that is independent of the fact that matter is composed of interacting particles.18 The author of this quote is referring primarily to physics, but he does point out that the second law is ""independent of details of models."" Besides, practically all evolutionary biologists are reductionists -- that is, they insist that there are no ""vitalist"" forces in living systems, and that all biological processes are explicable in terms of physics and chemistry. That being the case, biological processes also must operate in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics, and practically all biologists acknowledge this. Evolutionists commonly insist, however, that evolution is a fact anyhow, and that the conflict is resolved by noting that the earth is an ""open system,"" with the incoming energy from the sun able to sustain evolution throughout the geological ages in spite of the natural tendency of all systems to deteriorate toward disorganization. That is how an evolutionary entomologist has dismissed W. A. Dembski's impressive recent book, Intelligent Design. This scientist defends what he thinks is ""natural processes' ability to increase complexity"" by noting what he calls a ""flaw"" in ""the arguments against evolution based on the second law of thermodynamics."" And what is this flaw? Although the overall amount of disorder in a closed system cannot decrease, local order within a larger system can increase even without the actions of an intelligent agent.19 This naive response to the entropy law is typical of evolutionary dissimulation. While it is true that local order can increase in an open system if certain conditions are met, the fact is that evolution does not meet those conditions. Simply saying that the earth is open to the energy from the sun says nothing about how that raw solar heat is converted into increased complexity in any system, open or closed. The fact is that the best known and most fundamental equation of thermodynamics says that the influx of heat into an open system will increase the entropy of that system, not decrease it. All known cases of decreased entropy (or increased organization) in open systems involve a guiding program of some sort and one or more energy conversion mechanisms. Evolution has neither of these. Mutations are not ""organizing"" mechanisms, but disorganizing (in accord with the second law). They are commonly harmful, sometimes neutral, but never beneficial (at least as far as observed mutations are concerned). Natural selection cannot generate order, but can only ""sieve out"" the disorganizing mutations presented to it, thereby conserving the existing order, but never generating new order. In principle, it may be barely conceivable that evolution could occur in open systems, in spite of the tendency of all systems to disintegrate sooner or later. But no one yet has been able to show that it actually has the ability to overcome this universal tendency, and that is the basic reason why there is still no bona fide proof of evolution, past or present. From the statements of evolutionists themselves, therefore, we have learned that there is no real scientific evidence for real evolution. The only observable evidence is that of very limited horizontal (or downward) changes within strict limits. Evolution is Religion -- Not Science In no way does the idea of particles-to-people evolution meet the long-accepted criteria of a scientific theory. There are no such evolutionary transitions that have ever been observed in the fossil record of the past; and the universal law of entropy seems to make it impossible on any significant scale. Evolutionists claim that evolution is a scientific fact, but they almost always lose scientific debates with creationist scientists. Accordingly, most evolutionists now decline opportunities for scientific debates, preferring instead to make unilateral attacks on creationists. Scientists should refuse formal debates because they do more harm than good, but scientists still need to counter the creationist message.20 The question is, just why do they need to counter the creationist message? Why are they so adamantly committed to anti-creationism? The fact is that evolutionists believe in evolution because they want to. It is their desire at all costs to explain the origin of everything without a Creator. Evolutionism is thus intrinsically an atheistic religion. Some may prefer to call it humanism, and ""new age"" evolutionists place it in the context of some form of pantheism, but they all amount to the same thing. Whether atheism or humanism (or even pantheism), the purpose is to eliminate a personal God from any active role in the origin of the universe and all its components, including man. The core of the humanistic philosophy is naturalism -- the proposition that the natural world proceeds according to its own internal dynamics, without divine or supernatural control or guidance, and that we human beings are creations of that process. It is instructive to recall that the philosophers of the early humanistic movement debated as to which term more adequately described their position: humanism or naturalism. The two concepts are complementary and inseparable.21 Since both naturalism and humanism exclude God from science or any other active function in the creation or maintenance of life and the universe in general, it is very obvious that their position is nothing but atheism. And atheism, no less than theism, is a religion! Even doctrinaire-atheistic evolutionist Richard Dawkins admits that atheism cannot be proved to be true. Of course we can't prove that there isn't a God.22"
http://www.icr.org/home/resources/resources_tracts_scientificcaseagainstevolution/,0,"Therefore, they must believe it, and that makes it a religion. The atheistic nature of evolution is not only admitted, but insisted upon by most of the leaders of evolutionary thought. Ernst Mayr, for example, says that: Darwinism rejects all supernatural phenomena and causations.23 A professor in the Department of Biology at Kansas State University says: Even if all the data point to an intelligent designer, such a hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not naturalistic.24 It is well known by almost everyone in the scientific world today that such influential evolutionists as Stephen Jay Gould and Edward Wilson of Harvard, Richard Dawkins of England, William Provine of Cornell, and numerous other evolutionary spokesmen are dogmatic atheists. Eminent scientific philosopher and ardent Darwinian atheist Michael Ruse has even acknowledged that evolution is their religion! Evolution is promoted by its practitioners as more than mere science. Evolution is promulgated as an ideology, a secular religion -- a full-fledged alternative to Christianity, with meaning and morality . . . . Evolution is a religion. This was true of evolution in the beginning, and it is true of evolution still today.25 Another way of saying ""religion"" is ""worldview,"" the whole of reality. The evolutionary worldview applies not only to the evolution of life, but even to that of the entire universe. In the realm of cosmic evolution, our naturalistic scientists depart even further from experimental science than life scientists do, manufacturing a variety of evolutionary cosmologies from esoteric mathematics and metaphysical speculation. Socialist Jeremy Rifkin has commented on this remarkable game. Cosmologies are made up of small snippets of physical reality that have been remodeled by society into vast cosmic deceptions.26 They must believe in evolution, therefore, in spite of all the evidence, not because of it. And speaking of deceptions, note the following remarkable statement. We take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs, . . . in spite of the tolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated commitment to materialism. . . . we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counterintuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.27 The author of this frank statement is Richard Lewontin of Harvard. Since evolution is not a laboratory science, there is no way to test its validity, so all sorts of justso stories are contrived to adorn the textbooks. But that doesn't make them true! An evolutionist reviewing a recent book by another (but more critical) evolutionist, says: We cannot identify ancestors or ""missing links,"" and we cannot devise testable theories to explain how particular episodes of evolution came about. Gee is adamant that all the popular stories about how the first amphibians conquered the dry land, how the birds developed wings and feathers for flying, how the dinosaurs went extinct, and how humans evolved from apes are just products of our imagination, driven by prejudices and preconceptions.28 A fascinatingly honest admission by a physicist indicates the passionate commitment of establishment scientists to naturalism. Speaking of the trust students naturally place in their highly educated college professors, he says: And I use that trust to effectively brainwash them. . . . our teaching methods are primarily those of propaganda. We appeal -- without demonstration -- to evidence that supports our position. We only introduce arguments and evidence that supports the currently accepted theories and omit or gloss over any evidence to the contrary.29 Creationist students in scientific courses taught by evolutionist professors can testify to the frustrating reality of that statement. Evolution is, indeed, the pseudoscientific basis of religious atheism, as Ruse pointed out. Will Provine at Cornell University is another scientist who frankly acknowledges this. As the creationists claim, belief in modern evolution makes atheists of people. One can have a religious view that is compatible with evolution only if the religious view is indistinguishable from atheism.30 Once again, we emphasize that evolution is not science, evolutionists' tirades notwithstanding. It is a philosophical worldview, nothing more. (Evolution) must, they feel, explain everything. . . . A theory that explains everything might just as well be discarded since it has no real explanatory value. Of course, the other thing about evolution is that anything can be said because very little can be disproved. Experimental evidence is minimal.31 Even that statement is too generous. Actual experimental evidence demonstrating true evolution (that is, macroevolution) is not ""minimal."" It is nonexistent! The concept of evolution as a form of religion is not new. In my book, The Long War Against God,32 I documented the fact that some form of evolution has been the pseudo-rationale behind every anti-creationist religion since the very beginning of history. This includes all the ancient ethnic religions, as well as such modern world religions as Buddhism, Hinduism, and others, as well as the ""liberal"" movements in even the creationist religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam). As far as the twentieth century is concerned, the leading evolutionist is generally considered to be Sir Julian Huxley, primary architect of modern neo-Darwinism. Huxley called evolution a ""religion without revelation"" and wrote a book with that title (2nd edition, 1957). In a later book, he said: Evolution . . . is the most powerful and the most comprehensive idea that has ever arisen on earth.33 Later in the book he argued passionately that we must change ""our pattern of religious thought from a God-centered to an evolution-centered pattern.""34 Then he went on to say that: ""The God hypothesis . . . is becoming an intellectual and moral burden on our thought."" Therefore, he concluded that ""we must construct something to take its place.""35 That something, of course, is the religion of evolutionary humanism, and that is what the leaders of evolutionary humanism are trying to do today. In closing this survey of the scientific case against evolution (and, therefore, for creation), the reader is reminded again that all quotations in the article are from doctrinaire evolutionists. No Bible references are included, and no statements by creationists. The evolutionists themselves, to all intents and purposes, have shown that evolutionism is not science, but religious faith in atheism."
https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-against-evolution/misconceptions-about-creation/,0,"A recent article appeared on the Biologos website titled â€œ10 Misconceptions about Evolution.â€ The author, Jim Stump, writes, â€œOne of the difficulties people have with coming to accept the science of evolution is that they have absorbed incorrect or only partially correct information.â€ He then goes on to list 10 supposed misconceptions people have about evolution in order to encourage them to accept evolution. But what this latest article on the BioLogos website really points out are the misconceptions the senior editor of Biologos has about biblical creation! Biologos is an organization that â€œinvites the church and the world to see the harmony between science and biblical faith as we present an evolutionary understanding of Godâ€™s creation.â€ Basically, they promote evolution to Christians and churches and encourage Christians to add evolution and millions of years into Godâ€™s Word. Sadly, they are leading many Christians astray by encouraging them to trust manâ€™s opinion about the past over Godâ€™s trustworthy eyewitness account. Evolution Claims We Evolved from Monkeys The first and second misconceptions about evolution that Stump points out are two that weâ€™ve written about before: â€œevolution claims that we evolved from monkeysâ€ and â€œif we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys around?â€ Many well-meaning Christians have unknowingly perpetrated these misconceptions by using these faulty arguments. These are arguments creationists definitely shouldnâ€™t use. Evolutionists donâ€™t believe humans evolved from monkeys. Rather, they think that humans evolved from an ape-like ancestor and that monkeys and apes are our cousins. Of course, this directly contradicts Godâ€™s Word that teaches that humans were specially designed in Godâ€™s image, separate from the animal kingdom (Genesis 1:26â€“27, 2:7, 2:21â€“22). Second Law of Thermodynamics Disproves Evolution The third supposed misconception that Stump digs up is the argument that â€œthe 2nd Law of Thermodynamics disproves evolution.â€ The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics can be defined as when â€œenergy is transferred or transformed, more and more of it is wasted [entropy]. The Second Law also states that there is a natural tendency of any isolated system to degenerate into a more disordered state.â€ So when evolutionists say that the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics doesnâ€™t disprove evolution, what is generally meant by this, according to the evolutionary paradigm, is that the Earth and living organisms are open systems, not closed, and entropy can be checked in an open system; therefore, evolutionists believe the 2nd law does not disprove evolution."
https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-against-evolution/misconceptions-about-creation/,0,"According to astronomer, Dr. Danny Faulkner, The second law of thermodynamics applies to the universe as a whole. The entropy of the universe cannot decrease, though it may increase, and it often does. Thus, the universe has an ever-increasing entropy burden. An important manifestation of entropy is that it measures the amount of disorder. Since entropy continually increases, or at least cannot decrease, it follows that disorder must increase, or at least not decrease, and therefore order cannot increase. It is this version of the second law of thermodynamics that leads to discussion of the naturalistic origin of life and biological evolution. Evolutionists have offered various theories of how the naturalistic origin and development of life does not violate the second law of thermodynamics. One approach is to note that the second law of thermodynamics applies only to isolated systems. An isolated system exchanges neither matter nor energy with its surroundings. A closed system exchanges energy but not matter with its surroundings. An open system exchanges both matter and energy with its surroundings. Living things are continually exchanging both energy and matter with their surroundings, so they clearly are open systems, and are not isolated systems. However, merely being an open system does not automatically mean that entropy decreases. Life depends upon a huge number of complex biochemical reactions continually operating. These biochemical reactions operate opposite to the direction that they would naturally proceed. That is, living things synthesize simpler molecules into more complex ones. The inputs are matter and energy (required to bond the more complex molecules), which is why living things are open systems. However, these inputs are insufficient in themselves to circumvent the second law of thermodynamics. The direction of the chemical reactions normally is decay from the more complex to simpler molecules, the opposite of what living things require to exist. Given this, the appeal to an open system to rescue the day for evolution is not demonstrated and amounts to hand-waving and gross extrapolation. No New Information Can Be Added to DNA Stump then argues that itâ€™s a misconception that â€œno new information can be added to DNA through natural processes.â€ But this isnâ€™t a misconception at all. Itâ€™s just true. There is no known process that is able to create brand-new information of the type necessary for molecules-to-man evolution. There are processes that shuffle, delete, duplicate, or mutate information, but no processes that create brand-new information necessary for evolution. Information only comes from other information and, ultimately, from the Information-giver, God. He argues that genetic mutations and gene duplication can create new information, but they donâ€™t. All they do is work on already existing information. Evolution Is a Theory in Crisis"
https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-against-evolution/misconceptions-about-creation/,0,"He then moves onto the misconception that â€œevolution is a theory in crisisâ€ (ironically, this was the title of a 1985 book by Dr. Michael Denton, an evolutionist). Now, we donâ€™t argue that evolution is on its way out because itâ€™s â€œin crisis.â€ This would be sillyâ€”the vast majority of scientists are evolutionists (although some do doubt evolutionary ideas) because theyâ€™ve been indoctrinated to think that way. They interpret the evidence through the lens of evolutionary ideas because they have an evolutionary worldview. What we do point out are the huge problems with evolutionary ideas that should make it a theory in crisis! The evidence is much better explained through the lens of Godâ€™s Word and is consistent with a biblical worldview. There Are No Transitional Fossils He then moves on to say that itâ€™s a misconception to say that â€œthere are no transitional fossils.â€ He argues that there are â€œgobs of these in the fossil record.â€ But what there really are in the fossil record are billions of fossils that need to be interpreted. And how you interpret them depends on your worldview. If you approach the fossils with the idea that life evolved slowly over millions of years and the fossils provide the record of this, then thatâ€™s how you will interpret the fossils. We see this time and time again with new fossil discoveries. A fully formed and functional creature is discovered, and itâ€™s labeled a â€œtransitionalâ€ or â€œintermediateâ€ creature because itâ€™s interpreted that way based on assumptions about how life formed and how old the fossil is. A biblical creationist will go and look at the exact same fossil and reach an entirely different conclusion, that this is a fully formed organism that belonged to one of the original kinds God created, because we have an entirely different starting pointâ€”the true history revealed in Godâ€™s Word. Evolution Is Merely Historical Science He then moves into a few more supposed misconceptions that are obviously direct attacks against what AiG teaches. And here Stump makes enough straw man arguments to make a scarecrow army! He says itâ€™s a misconception that â€œevolution is merely â€˜Historical Scienceâ€™ and therefore canâ€™t be tested or confirmed.â€ He says this â€œperpetuates massive misunderstanding about scienceâ€ and that â€œthere are lots of different â€˜sciencesâ€™, and lots of ink has been spilled attempting to give a precise definition of what it is to be science . . . And there is no one sanctioning body who has the authority to determine what counts as real science and what doesnâ€™t.â€ No creationist or creationist organization is attempting to be a â€œsanctioning body.â€ All weâ€™re doing is pointing out the obvious difference between doing the scientific method in the present and trying to reconstruct what happened in the unobserved and unrepeatable past. He goes on to attempt to show how evolution follows the scientific method and how therefore there shouldnâ€™t be a division between historical and observational science. But what he fails to point out is the role of presuppositions in interpretation of what happened in the past. You see, with observational science you are dealing with the present. Itâ€™s directly testable, observable, and repeatable. Any scientist should be able to do the same experiment and get the same result. But historical science is very different. It deals with the unobservable, unrepeatable, and untestable past. Sure, you can observe and draw hypotheses from the evidence (e.g., fossils and rock layers). But you canâ€™t test or repeat it, and you canâ€™t observe how it actually formed because you werenâ€™t there. So what you believe about the pastâ€”millions of years or biblical creationâ€”will directly influence how you interpret the evidence. Evolution Is Manâ€™s Word, Creationism Is Godâ€™s Word He then states that itâ€™s a misconception that â€œevolution is manâ€™s word, Creationism is Godâ€™s word.â€ He then makes this bizarre red herring argument: â€œFirst, it should be noted that there are lots of women working on evolution too.â€ This is just a silly thing to say. Obviously when creationists say â€œmanâ€™s word,â€ we donâ€™t mean the word of males alone. We mean the words and ideas of humanity as a whole juxtaposed against Godâ€™s Word. He then says, â€œif the claim is that Young Earth Creationism . . . is Godâ€™s Word, that is dangerously close to blasphemy.â€ This is a ridiculous claim. If by â€œyoung earth creationismâ€ he means that God created in six, literal, 24-hour days, only around 6,000 years ago and that the world was destroyed by a global Flood and the nations were dispersed at the tower of Babel then, yes, this is Godâ€™s Word. Anyone can open the Bible, as countless Christians before us have, and get this exact picture of Earthâ€™s history because it comes directly from the pages of Scripture. Whatâ€™s â€œdangerously close to blasphemyâ€ is to say that you know more than God, ignore what His Word says, and instead listen to the ideas of fallible, sinful humans. Now, if by â€œyoung earth creationismâ€ he means the models we build based on the Bibleâ€™s revealed history (i.e. the Flood caused the Ice Age), then anyone who has read our literature knows that we would never say that these models are â€œGodâ€™s Word.â€ They are subject to change as more evidence is uncovered. But the basic truths of history that come from Godâ€™s Word are not subject to change because they come directly from the One who was there."
https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-against-evolution/misconceptions-about-creation/,0,"The Plain Reading of Scripture Supports Young-Earth Creationism His ninth supposed misconception is that â€œThe plain reading of Scripture clearly supports six day Creationism.â€ He says, â€œIf â€˜plain readingâ€™ means â€˜what the words clearly mean in my language and cultureâ€™, then I suppose Exodus 20:11 could be used to support six day Creationism.â€ Here he fails to acknowledge the vast amount of work that creationists have done in the original biblical languages and fails to explain how â€œfor in six days the Lord made the heavens, the earth, the sea and all that in them isâ€ could mean anything but the obvious in English or Hebrewâ€”God created in six days. He then moves into an argument weâ€™ve heard many times before and that really is just a straw man that shows an ignorance of how to read the Bible: â€œBut if that is really how weâ€™re supposed to read Scripture, then 1 Samuel 2:8 means the earth is set on pillars, and Deuteronomy 21:21 means we should stone our rebellious sons, and John 15:5 means Jesus is a plant, and Roman 16:16 means we should kiss everyone we meet.â€ This is nonsense and he knows it when he says â€œthere are reasons we donâ€™t take the plain meaning of those other verses as the best interpretation of Scripture.â€ First Samuel 2:8 is a poetic prayer and is obviously using a metaphor to describe how God upholds the universe, Deuteronomy 21:21 is Old Testament law, John 15:5 is unmistakably a metaphor, and Romans 16:16 is set in an entirely different cultural context but finding a direct equivalent (i.e. handshaking) is not difficult at all. All Stump has done here is constructed a straw man argument that insinuates that we ignore basic biblical interpretation (which a quick search on our website will debunk) rather than actually addressing any of the arguments that biblical creationists really make or even the relevant biblical text itself. Christian Evolutionist Scholars Desire Professional Advancement? Lastly, he says â€œChristian scholars accept the Evolutionary Creation position out of the desire for professional advancement.â€ Neither we nor any other reputable creation ministry we know makes such a claim. There are many different reasons a Christian might accept evolutionary ideas but, really, it all boils down to either not knowing there is another option or compromise with manâ€™s word instead of trusting in Godâ€™s Word. Myths About Evolution? The supposed misconceptions about evolution that Stump highlighted largely werenâ€™t misconceptions about evolution but were actually misconceptions about creation! Instead of fairly presenting what creationists teach, Stump, as with so many others who espouse evolutionary teaching, chose to ignore our actual arguments and wrestle with straw men that they created themselves. If you would like to learn more about some actual myths and misconceptions about evolution, you can read â€œTop Ten: Myths About Evolution.â€"
https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-against-evolution/were-you-there/,0,"In an article published online by Slate,1 another swipe has been taken at the idea of teaching biblical creation to children and teaching them a false view of science. Positioning the biblical truth against the evolutionary view of the history of the universe and life here on Earth, the article opens and closes with a question made popular by Ken Ham. The author grew up in a home and church family that taught her biblical truth. Sitting in her biology class, she felt uncomfortable when the topic of evolution came up, knowing that it conflicted with what she had been taught from Godâ€™s Word.2 A Change in Foundations Being faithful to what she believed at the time, she waited for the appropriate time to ask her biology teacher â€œWere you there?â€ as he presented the ideas of deep-time evolution to the class. Her question was sincere, and she was pursuing what she had been taughtâ€”the Bible as the Word of God refutes the idea that evolution happened and affirms special creation. Whether the cosmological evolution of the big bang, the slow and gradual development of Earthâ€™s geological evolution, or the biological evolution that formed all the living things from the nonliving chemicals that made up the primordial Earth. She knew billions of years didnâ€™t align with the Bible, which teaches the universe is approximately 6,000 years old. Clearly, 6,000 is a far cry from 13,700,000,000â€”these are incompatible teachings. But as she grew older and heard the evolutionary view taught, her thinking shifted. The Bible became an untrustworthy relic and â€œWere you there?â€ now seemed like a silly question. But that doesnâ€™t mean she is correct in dismissing this as a silly question, and I am not sure she really understood the intent behind the question based on what she has written in this article. So how should we use â€œWere you there?â€ to engage and challenge the evolution story of the universe and promote the biblical creation view? Sincerely Avoiding Straw Men There is something telling in the authorâ€™s explanation of how she approached challenging the teaching in her public schoolâ€”she doesnâ€™t seem to have cared to really understand the evolutionary view. During one of Wortmanâ€™s [her science teacher] lectures on natural selectionâ€”involving different types of bacteriaâ€”I was doodling. Normally an attentive student, I deliberately tuned out of the class. The subject made me uncomfortable because the process of new species coming about via natural selection directly contradicted what my church and parents taught me about the origins of life. . . . We were encouraged to confront anyone who seemed to assume that evolution is true with a simple question meant to stump them: Were you there?3 This attitude is lamentable, and it is not one we should promote as we teach our children to understand the creation evolution debate. If we take what she presents on its face, the way she was taught to defend her faith was not biblical. Natural selection is a real process that we can observe, and there is nothing unbiblical about new species arising through natural selection. The biblical boundary is of one kind of animal or plant changing into another kindâ€”like a fish changing into an amphibian. In fact, the way God has designed bacteria to adapt to varying environments in the fallen world is a testimony of His power over and care for His creation."
https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-against-evolution/were-you-there/,0,"If we simply tell the evolutionist that we think his idea is silly and he wasnâ€™t even there to witness what he is claiming, he is going to dismiss our arguments as superficial. And rightly so since we would not really be dealing with what he believes. Likewise, if a Christian speaks to a skeptic who dismisses Christianity by telling us he doesnâ€™t believe in a bearded man who doesnâ€™t want us to eat pork and who committed child abuse to save us from our sin, we would dismiss his argument as a straw manâ€”he isnâ€™t arguing against what we really believe. If we are going to challenge evolutionary views and train our children to do the same, we need to do so sincerely, seeking to understand the false views so that we might compare them to the light of Scripture, exposing the darkened philosophies of human reasoning that deny God as Creator (Romans 1:18â€“23; Colossians 2:1â€“10). Pointing to God as Creator â€œWere you there?â€ is a great question, but it canâ€™t be left at that, as the author describes being taught. The intent of the question is not to simply dismiss a historical claim out of hand, but to point to God as the Creator. The clever skeptic will respond to the question by turning it back on the Christian, asking them if they were there to witness God creating the universe in six days. And that is where we turn the conversation toward God and the hope of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Another common response might include something like the following from the evolutionist science teacher in the article: He said that he didnâ€™t need to witness evolution to know it occurred; fossil evidence shows us that humans evolved from a common ancestor with apes. This type of response exposes the commitment to the underlying philosophy and assumptions of naturalism. While they claim they can â€œknowâ€ evolution occurred, if they were honest they would say they â€œbelieveâ€ evolution occurred. If they were honest, they would admit that the charge they level against Christians who believe in biblical creationâ€”â€œYou just believe that because it is what the Bible saysâ€â€”could be directed right back at themselves. They believe humans evolved from ape-like creatures because they are committed to the evolutionary worldview. Another important point to help them recognize is that evidence doesnâ€™t â€œshowâ€ evolutionary progression. Evidence doesnâ€™t speak for itselfâ€”it must be interpreted."
https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-against-evolution/were-you-there/,0,""" â€œWere you there?â€ is not intended to ask a question of personal presence, but to point to God, who was there. It is to expose the worldview and the presuppositions through which the past is interpreted. Of course we know that the person promoting the evolutionary views was not there billions or millions of years ago to witness a fish changing slowly into a land-dwelling creature. The question is intended to help the evolutionist recognize that they are making a historical claim apart from any eyewitness testimony. But Christians do have an eyewitness testimony. But a witness is only as good as his character. The witness we point to is the very Creator Himselfâ€”the Triune God of the Bible. The Father, Son, and Spirit were involved in the Creation (Genesis 1:1â€“2; John 1:1â€“5; Hebrews 1:1â€“4). We know that we can trust what God has said because He is a faithful and truthful God who cannot lie or deny His own perfect character (Titus 1:1â€“3; Hebrews 6:17â€“18). Further, God has revealed to us through human authors how He created the universe and the world we live in (Genesis 1â€“2; 2 Peter 1:20â€“21). We have an eyewitness testimony that explains the historical claims we make about the age of the Earth, the origin of plants and animals, and the first humans to walk the planet. The skeptic might protest that the Bible is not trustworthy, that God hasnâ€™t spoken clearly, or that He doesnâ€™t even exist. Rather than trusting the Bibleâ€™s eyewitness testimony, they prefer to trust the reasoning of other people. Here is the crux of the matterâ€”this is an issue of authority. â€œWere you there?â€ should be used to call people to acknowledge that they are placing their trust in one of two placesâ€”the ideas of fallible men or the eyewitness testimony of the perfect Creator God. Worldviews and Authority Underlying this issue is an idea that is evident in the authorâ€™s presentation of how her thinking shifted from believing the Bibleâ€™s account of history to the evolutionary view. Her thinking shifted from looking at the world through the lens of Scripture to looking at the world through the lens of humanism and its underlying tenet of naturalismâ€”a form of atheism. The starting assumption in this religious and philosophical view demands that man can use his own reasoning to determine truth and only natural explanations are allowed to answer questions in historical science (origins science). No one needs to directly observe an aquatic species slowly evolving the ability to crawl onto dry land in order for scientists to surmise that mammals evolved from a fish. As Wortman said, we can observe the evidence in the fossil record and draw reasonable conclusions. We must not forget two important pointsâ€”facts donâ€™t speak for themselves and everyone has the same evidence. Knowing these two things, we should never say that there is evidence for creation or evidence for evolution. The fossil evidence mentioned in the article is common to everyone and must be interpreted to present arguments and explanations for how old it is, how it died, what it ate, and other historical questions that are not able to be directly observed, repeated, or tested."""
https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-against-evolution/were-you-there/,0,"In her new thinking, the evidence is interpreted through the lens of naturalism rather than Scriptureâ€”but she doesnâ€™t seem to see the hypocrisy of her own statements. She says it is proper for the evidence to be interpreted from a naturalistic philosophy that denies God exists or was involved in creation, but not from a supernatural view. But why is one philosophical foundation appropriate and the other inappropriate in a scientific investigation about the past? If matter is all that exists, how do they account for the existence of logic or the laws of nature? They rely on these ideas to inform their scientific study, but they have no foundation to explain why these ideas should exist. To choose natural, evolutionary processes over a supernatural explanation is merely an arbitrary preference, not a demand of scientific investigation. When approaching the topic as a Christian, we have the only true and reasonable starting pointâ€”the existence of the Creator God and His revelation to us. If God does not exist, as the atheist demands, we have no reason to believe that logic or the laws of nature should exist. Historical and Origins Science It is evident that the author does not understand the distinction between historical science and operational science. Biblical creationists involved in scientific endeavors can agree with much of the scientific study that happens in the laboratories to understand how things work and apply that knowledge to technologies like computers, medicines, and transportation. We can agree with the sequence of the DNA in different organisms and the structure of biological molecules. We part ways when those facts are used to interpret events in the pastâ€”historical or origins science. Because God has revealed to us that He created distinct kinds of organisms from the beginning, we must reject the idea that a fish evolved into a frog. A worldview based on evolution is not using science that is observable, repeatable, and testable, but simply surmising how that fish changed into a frog. The worldview determines the interpretation. Naturalism or atheism demands a natural mechanism of accidental interactions over billions of years of evolution. Sincere Apologetics If that is all this author was trained to do, those who taught her did a poor job.4 We need to teach a fair representation of the unbiblical views so that there is a clear understanding and ability to communicate and challenge false ideas. If we teach a false view of evolution that mocks and dismisses evolutionists, how will a child or young adult respond when they hear an evangelist for evolutionary views present a case that seems orderly and logical? It is no surprise that those students who have heard a misrepresentation of the evolutionary view respond with sincere questions and intrigue about the validity of the ideas when presented with a persuasive argument for evolution. As Christians, we would expect the same as we share the truth about Christianity with someone who has only heard partial truths or misrepresentations about what the Bible really teaches. Donâ€™t be afraid to challenge those who believe in evolution, whether Christians or atheists, with the question â€œWere you there?â€ But also be prepared to use it to point to the eyewitness testimony of the God who has created us, reminding them that the God who created us also stepped into history as our Savior (Genesis 1; John 1). Jesus Christ is Creator, Savior, and Lord, so let us use these opportunities to call those who believe in evolution to repent and look to Christ as Lord."
http://www.changinglives.org.au/evolution.html,0,"What does the theory of evolution need to explain? If biologists propose the evolution of life (by natural processes and mutations) then the scientific community (scientists who study cosmology and abiogenesis) need to be able to explain how the raw materials (the earth, the sun and the first cell) essential for the evolution of life came into being. If you have no sun, earth or first cell we can have no evolution of life. In the evolutionist framework, the sun, the earth and the first cell came about by random, mindless, blind and unguided processes. Random, mindless, blind and unguided processes never achieve anything. In natural selection, the environment affects the gene frequency in a population. Even so, natural selection is a mindless and blind process acting on mutations which are random, mindless and blind. Evolution (which is mindless and blind) will never achieve anything. Read our answer to the question: ""Does evolution of life in reality have anything more than just â€˜sheer higgledy-piggledy luckâ€™?"" EVIDENCE 1: The universe could NOT have created itself nor has it always existed a. The universe could NOT have created itself In his latest book, misleadingly entitled The Grand Design, Steven Hawking makes the adventurous claim that â€œbecause there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing.â€ Think about that. Dr. John Lennox (Professor in Mathematics at Oxford University acknowledges that Hawking is a brilliant theoretical physicist but responds to Hawkingâ€™s assertion that â€œthe universe can and will create itself from nothingâ€ with; â€œThat sounds to me like something out of Alice in Wonderland ... itâ€™s not science!â€11 Lennox explains by saying; ""If I say â€œX creates X,â€ I presuppose the existence of X in order to account for the existence of X. To presuppose the existence of the universe to account for its existence is logically incoherent.""12 Or put simply; â€œFrom nothing, nothing comes!â€ or â€œNo-thing cannot do anything!â€13 In relation to Hawking's latest idea Dr. Lennox rightly concludes; ""What this all goes to show is that nonsense remains nonsense, even when talked by world-famous scientists"".14 The universe cannot have created itself! Ravi Zacharias and John Lennox discuss Stephenâ€™s Hawkingâ€™s ideas in his latest book entitled The Grand Design (4 part audio) b. The universe could NOT have always existed The idea that the universe has always been in existence has been thoroughly rejected on scientific grounds. The Laws of Thermodynamics show the universe must have had a beginning. The First Law of Thermodynamics says that there is only a finite amount of energy and the Second Law says that the amount of available energy is continually decreasing. If the universe had existed forever, all the available existing energy would have already been used up. THE ONLY LOGICAL CONCLUSION The only logical / scientific explanation for the existence of the universe is that it was created by an outside intelligence. EVIDENCE 2: The Second Law of Thermodynamics says no! The Second Law of Thermodynamics tells us that a system will always go from order to disorder unless there is a plan or outside intelligence to organize it. World-renowned evolutionist Isaac Asimov when discussing the Second Law of Thermodynamics said: ""Another way of stating the second law then is: 'The universe is constantly getting more disorderly!'"" Viewed that way we can see the second law all about us. We have to work hard to straighten a room, but left to itself it becomes a mess again very quickly and very easily. Even if we never enter it, it becomes dusty and musty. How difficult to maintain houses, and machinery, and our own bodies in perfect working order: how easy to let them deteriorate. In fact, all we have to do is nothing, and everything deteriorates, collapses, breaks down, wears out, all by itself - and that is what the second law is all about.""1 As Isaac Asimov says, everything becomes 'a mess ... deteriorates, collapses, breaks down, wears out, all by itself'. Now in complete opposition to one of most firmly established laws in science (the Second Law of Thermodynamics), people who support the theory of Evolution would have us believe that things become more organised and complex when left to themselves! Some people argue that the earth is an open system and therefore the Second Law of Thermodynamics does not apply. Simply pouring in energy (sunlight) into the earth does not override the Second Law of Thermodynamics. As shown in Isaac Asimov's quote above, the Second Law still applies on earth. Pouring energy into a system makes things more disordered!"
http://www.changinglives.org.au/evolution.html,0,"The brilliant scientist Lord Kelvin who actually formulated the Second Law of Thermodynamics says for very good scientific reasons; ""Overwhelming strong proofs of intelligent and benevolent design lie around us ... the atheistic idea is so non-sensical that I cannot put it into words."" 9 As Dr John Ross of Harvard University rightly states:""â€¦ there are no known violations of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Ordinarily the second law is stated for isolated systems, but the second law applies equally well to open systems. â€¦""7 Evolution has no plan or outside intelligence and, according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, can never take place. Second Law of Thermodynamics - Does this basic law of nature prevent Evolution? EVIDENCE 3. Living Things Never Arise from Non-living Things To produce a living thing you must start with a living thing. Evolution requires non-living matter to turn into a living organism and this has never been observed. A Biology textbook puts it like this: ""As we have seen, the life of every organism comes from its parents or parent. Does life ever spring from nonliving matter? We can find no evidence of this happening. So far as we can tell, life comes only from life. Biologists call this the principal of biogenesis."" 8 So when it comes to real science (i.e. things we can actually establish by observation and experiment) life always comes from life! Evolutionists insist life came from nonliving matter but they have no way of proving this. Just saying something repeatedly doesn't make it true! Why Is Abiogenesis Impossible? EVIDENCE 4: Complex Systems do not evolve 'bit by bit' In the following quote, Darwin himself acknowledges the logical absurdity of a complex organ like the eye being formed using the natural processes he was suggesting in his theory. Darwinâ€™s own deductive reasoning should have caused him to reject his own theory but sadly it did not and Darwin continued to promote his theory of trying to explain the complexity of life using natural processes only. We are NOT saying that the following quote was Darwinâ€™s conclusion but that it should have been Darwinâ€™s conclusion. Darwin said: ""To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree."" 3 No mechanism has been put forward that even begins to explain how something like the human eye could have been produced by time, chance, natural selection and mutation. A baby needs a number of very complex, interdependent systems to live and survive. These systems include the nervous, digestive, excretory, circulatory, skeletal, muscular and an immune system. For the baby to survive and live each system requires all the other systems to be functioning. Therefore all these systems must be in operation at the same time and could not have evolved slowly over millions of years. Think of the amazing intricacy of the male reproductive system coming about by time, chance and random mutation. It would need to be fully functional all along the evolutionary timeline so that reproduction could continue. And remember this highly unlikely progression would be pointless unless the female reproductive system had randomly evolved in perfect sync to compliment the developing male system so they both worked in harmony over the millions of years of evolutionary refinement! Of course, this logic applies to all the other species on earth as well. There is no evidence anywhere of the evolution of such systems. More than that, not even any hypothetical process can be thought of to explain how something like the brain and the digestive system could have evolved bit by bit over time! Can evolution be the source of life in all its complexity? EVIDENCE 5: The Missing Links are Still Missing If evolution was true, there should be large numbers of intermediate fossil organisms present in the fossil record. Despite over a hundred years of intensive world wide research into the fossil record, the 'missing links' are still well and truly 'missing'. Evolutionists such as Stephen Jay Gould reluctantly concede this when they say, ""The evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches; the rest is inference, however reasonable, not based on the evidence of fossils."" 2 What does the fossil record teach us about evolution? Who's who & what's what in the world of ""missing"" links? Is there fossil evidence of 'missing links' between humans and apes? Did ancient humans live millions of years ago?"
http://www.changinglives.org.au/evolution.html,0,"EVIDENCE 6: Mutations are contrary to Evolution Natural selection (better adapted organisms surviving to pass on genetic material) cannot produce evolution because it produces no NEW genetic material. Mutations are random changes in the genetic makeup of organisms. Evolutionists say that mutations supply the new genes needed for evolution to proceed. For over 1500 generations, fruit flies have been subjected to radiation and chemicals.4 This caused mutations in the flies. If you take a human generation to be 25 years, this is equal to around 37 500 years (1500 x 25) in human terms. What happened to these mutated flies over this time? Firstly, they were still flies and had not evolved into anything else! Secondly the flies as a population were worse off with many dying, having curly wings or stubby wings. Mutations are an example of the Second Law of Thermodynamics (when things are left to themselves they become more disordered over time). It is amazing that evolutionists would put forward mutations as the mechanism by which evolution could somehow take place! A person with one sickle-cell anaemia gene (a mutation) and malaria has more chance of surviving malaria than a person without the mutated gene. Evolutionists point to this as evolution in action. Read more on malaria / sickle-cell anaemia Evolution (things becoming more ordered) and mutations (things becoming more disordered) are processes going in opposite directions! Mutations are not a friend of evolution but an enemy that ultimately cuts the theory down and destroys it! Can genetic mutations produce positive changes in living creatures? EVIDENCE 7: Probability Facts are also contrary to Evolution Evolutionists such as Sir Fred Hoyle concede this when they say ""The chance that higher life forms might have emerged in this way (time and chance) is comparable with the chance that 'a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein.'""5 In a desperate attempt to override the very powerful argument that life could never arise by chance, Richard Dawkins conjectures that â€œIf the odds of life originating spontaneously on a planet were a billion to one against â€¦â€10 A billion to one is only 1 in 10 to the 9th power. BUT the probability of even one single protein molecule consisting of 200 amino acids arising spontaneously by chance is 1 in 10 raised to power of 260. This is calculated by raising 20 (the number of different types amino acids available) to the power of 200 (the number of amino acids in the protein chain). Even if the whole universe was packed with amino acids combining frantically for billions of years, it would not produce even one such protein molecule let alone produce a living cell. Read our answer to the question: ""Does evolution of life in reality have anything more than just â€˜sheer higgledy-piggledy luckâ€™?"" Let's now put this in its larger context. Proteins are 'made' by genes in the cell. * The average human gene consists of 3000 bases, but sizes vary greatly, with the largest known human gene being dystrophin at 2.4 million bases. * The total number of human genes is estimated at 30,000. * The human genome has some 3 billion DNA base pairs. Except for mature red blood cells, all human cells contain a complete genome! * The constellation of all proteins in a cell is called its proteome. Unlike the relatively unchanging genome, the dynamic proteome changes from minute to minute in response to tens of thousands of intra- and extracellular environmental signals. A proteinâ€™s chemistry and behavior are specified by the gene sequence and by the number and identities of other proteins made in the same cell at the same time and with which it associates and reacts. * Finally, It is estimated that the human body may contain over two million different proteins, each with a unique function. There is no chance that the human body could have come about by chance! Probability Arguments in Why Is Abiogenesis Impossible?

http://creation.com/theological-case-against-evolution,0,"We all like science. In fact, we couldnâ€™t live without it. Science has helped us put man on the moon, put the Internet in our pockets, see 14 billion light-years into space, and unveil a universe of microbiological machines within each living cell. Science has given us life-saving vaccines against polio, smallpox and measles. Yet science owes an incredible debt to theology.1 History repeatedly demonstrates that where men have built their epistemic foundations upon Scripture, their science has flourished.2 But subsequent to the â€œAge of Enlightenmentâ€ (c. 1650â€“1800), science has ascended to the throne, happily usurping the Scriptures in every place she can. As Michael Bauman puts it, â€œTheology, the Queen of the Sciences, has been banished to the back of the bus by her own bigoted descendants.â€3 We need to remember that man is fallible, and as the history of science has repeatedly shown, so is science. One of the most audacious and specious theories to fall under the broad umbrella of â€˜scienceâ€™ in the last 200 years is the notion that everything evolved over billions of years. The theory suffers from innumerable theological, philosophical and scientific problems. But in this article I would ask you to consider the following theological problems created by maintaining an evolutionary account of origins. It makes death our friend instead of our enemy. Theistic evolutionists, in an endeavour to embrace both Darwin and Moses, claim that God created all the original kinds of animals and plants through a process of natural selection (contra Genesis 1â€“2). Natural selection is indeed a recognised phenomenon at work on our planet, empowered by the reality of death. But according to Genesis 3, death came as a result of Adamâ€™s disobedience and Godâ€™s curse upon this earth.4 When we reject this history, we are compelled instead to view death, bloodshed, violence, disease and the general struggle for survival as the God-given blessings of a perfect world. Yet this makes little sense of 1 Corinthians 15:26, and construes the God of creation to be a moral monster. History repeatedly demonstrates that where men have built their epistemic foundations upon Scripture, their science has flourished. It calls into question the meaning of â€˜goodâ€™ because God called a world typified by death, disease, pain and strife, â€œgoodâ€. This has a direct bearing on how we think about God who is, in himself, the ultimate standard of goodness (Mark 10:18) and how we construct our theodicy5â€”one of the greatest challenges in apologetics. Without the historicity of the fall of man and its ramifications on creation, the distinction between good and evil is lost."
http://creation.com/theological-case-against-evolution,0,"It calls into question the authority of Scripture. An obvious contradiction exists between the record of our origins in Genesis and the popular story of evolution: The source of Creation. God created the world (Genesis 1:1). This is in contradiction to atheism and philosophical naturalism, one of the major premises inspiring the idea of evolution. Thus Dawkins writes, â€œalthough atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.6â€ Similarly, Peter Lawrence writes, â€œIn this vital mission to discredit the supernatural, nothing has proved more important than The Origin of Species.â€7The order of Creation. God created the earth before the creation of the solar system (Genesis 1:1 & 1:14â€“18). God created light before He created the sun (Genesis 1:3, 16). God created the plants before the creation of stars, moon and sun (Genesis 1:11). God created the birds before the creation of land-dwelling animals (Genesis 1:20). The mechanism of Creation. God created all things out of nothingâ€”not using pre-existing material (Hebrews 11:3). God created all the plants and animals according to their kinds, instead of a single organism which evolved from one kind into another, and then into everything else (Genesis 1:12, 21, 24). God created man directly from the dust of the earth, not from another animal (Genesis 2:7)."
http://creation.com/theological-case-against-evolution,0,"God created man in his image and gave him dominion over the animals, thereby making him distinct from the animals (Genesis 1:26). The time of Creation. God created the world in six days8 as opposed to vast ages/epochs of time (cf. Genesis 1, Exodus 20:11) God created man at the beginning of time, not the end of time. Jesus claimed in Mark 10:6, â€œfrom the beginning of creation, â€˜God made them male and femaleâ€™â€ â€¦ as opposed to at the end of creation. According to the evolutionary timescale, mankind appears only as an appendix at the end of billions or years of evolutionary struggle. So the real question is â€œWas Jesus wrong?â€ (Other NT references to mankind being created at the beginning not the end of creation include Luke 11:50â€“51 and Romans 1:20). This has led some, like the prominent theistic evolutionist, Francis Collins, to write: â€œIf Jesus as a finite human being erred from time to time, there is no reason at all to suppose that Moses, Paul, John wrote Scripture without error. Rather, we are wise to assume that the biblical authors expressed themselves as human beings writing from the perspectives of their own finite, broken horizons.â€9 If true, this would bring into question everything else spoken by Jesus and would undermine the inspiration and infallibility of Scripture10. The completion of Creation. According to Godâ€™s word, the creation of the universe has been completed (Genesis 2:3 and Exodus 20:11). God is no longer creating the cosmos. Yet on evolutionary terms, the universe and everything in it are still evolving. The goodness of Creation. As already mentioned, death, disease, cancer, pain and suffering came after the fall of man, not before. Evolution, via the uniformitarian interpretation of the fossil record, places all these fallen elements before man even appears on the scene. If God intended animals to kill each other in a perfect world, why does he describe the new heavens and new earth using language like: â€œThe wolf and the lamb shall graze together; the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and dust shall be the serpentâ€™s food. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountainâ€ (Isaiah 65:25). It also makes no sense of Romans 8:20â€“22 and Revelation 21:4. It sets a hermeneutical precedent. Two millennia worth of commentaries on the book of Genesis bear witness to the fact that the orthodox interpretation has been the straightforward, literal approach to the text, taking the creation narrative as history.11 But today there are many competing interpretations of Genesis. It is worth noting, therefore, that the framework hypothesis, day-age theory, gap-theory, analogical days theory, Genesis-as-myth, progressive creation and theistic evolutionary theories all find their origin in the 19th and 20th centuries. As Hall has observed, â€œit is a very difficult task to reproduce pre-1800 Christian literature that both employs rigorous exegetical methodology and that defends something other than a literal interpretation of Genesis 1â€“11.â€12 If we allow popular opinion to preside over the interpretation of the first book of the Bible, what stops us from butchering the other 65? If weâ€™re going to put on naturalistic glasses to resolve the question of originsâ€”is there anything to stop us taking that framework of interpretation elsewhere? Floating axe heads, the virgin birth, water turning into wine, the multiplication of loaves and fishes, Jesus walking on water and the resurrection of the dead are not even remotely feasible according to â€˜scienceâ€™. So should we let â€˜scienceâ€™ dictate here also? One compromise leads to another."
http://creation.com/theological-case-against-evolution,0,"When Christians capitulate to canonising popular opinion over the Word of God, non-Christians sit back and laugh because their suspicions are once again confirmed, i.e. science holds all the cards, not Scripture. It makes a mockery of Christ and Christianity. Genesis is effectively relegated to the status of a â€˜just-soâ€™ story. When Christians capitulate to canonising popular opinion over the Word of God, non-Christians sit back and laugh because their suspicions are once again confirmed, i.e. science holds all the cards, not Scripture. Consider the claims of the 19th century sceptic, George Foote, who wrote, â€œAnd if man himself has descended, or ascended, from lower forms of life; if he has been developed through thousands of generations from a branch of the Simian family; it necessarily follows that the Garden of Eden is a fairy tale, that Adam and Eve were not the parents of the human race, that the Fall is an oriental legend, that Original Sin is a theological libel on humanity, that the Atonement is an unintelligible dogma, and the Incarnation a relic of ancient mythology.â€13 It deprives us of real answers concerning origins, and leaves the biggest argument for naturalism, atheism or agnosticism unchallenged. Without evolution, these worldviews are entirely bankrupt. When we decide not to discuss or debate on matters of origin, we effectively leave the pagan world unchallenged. It becomes the Achillesâ€™ heel of our apologetics. To leave the origins discussion merely at the â€œsomething or someone did itâ€ level is entirely unhelpful because most of the world believes that a thing or a being made this universe. This is not where the debate is at. Even Dawkins14 and Hawking15 have recently conceded that aliens could have done it. The real problem here is the authority of Godâ€™s word versus the evolutionary story of origins. Itâ€™s only when people submit to Scripture that they will find Christ. They wonâ€™t find Christ in science, although a careful reflection upon the magnificence of Godâ€™s creation might lead them to Scripture. Therefore, in order to effectively address the question of origins in a way that is relevant and helpful to people, we need to let the Bible speak (Romans 10:17)! If we are not prepared to accept the inspired eye-witness testimony of someone who was there at the beginning, who actually made it all and told us how he did it, we lose the only answers we have in this world to help the millions of people today who are asking those kinds of questions. For example, Marcus Dods (1834â€“1909), writing only a decade after Darwin, exhorted his readers, in the opening paragraph of his commentary on Genesis with: â€œIf any one is in search of accurate information regarding the age of this earth, or its relation to the sun, moon, and stars, or regarding the order in which plants and animals have appeared upon it, he is referred to recent text-books in astronomy, geology, and palaeontology. No one for a moment dreams of referring a serious student of these subjects to the Bible as a source of information.â€16 Why do we so readily defer to the speculations of men on our origins when they were never there in the beginning to observe it? The only authority we have on the subject of creation is Godâ€”not man. Questions about origins are primarily theological (and historical), not scientific. If we disregard the Bible in our investigation we lose the only authoritative data we have! It robs God of his glory. Evolutionists claim that this world is not the product of creative intelligence but instead the result of a fantastic fortuitous fluke. Any theistic synthesis with evolution does little to improve upon this robbery. The claim that God made this world using a brutally wasteful, mindless, random process over billions of years undermines the infinite wisdom and creative brilliance employed in the careful construction of our universe. We give credit to artists, inventors, architects and engineers for their intelligent designs. Why do we rob God of the credit He deserves? Consider Psalm 19. To conclude with the words of Robert Jastrow, â€œFor the scientist who has lived by faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuriesâ€¦â€17 Will you be with those at the top of the mountain?"
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/15-answers-to-creationist/,1,"When Charles Darwin introduced the theory of evolution through natural selection 143 years ago, the scientists of the day argued over it fiercely, but the massing evidence from paleontology, genetics, zoology, molecular biology and other fields gradually established evolution's truth beyond reasonable doubt. Today that battle has been won everywhere--except in the public imagination. Embarrassingly, in the 21st century, in the most scientifically advanced nation the world has ever known, creationists can still persuade politicians, judges and ordinary citizens that evolution is a flawed, poorly supported fantasy. They lobby for creationist ideas such as ""intelligent design"" to be taught as alternatives to evolution in science classrooms. As this article goes to press, the Ohio Board of Education is debating whether to mandate such a change. Some antievolutionists, such as Philip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley and author of Darwin on Trial, admit that they intend for intelligent-design theory to serve as a ""wedge"" for reopening science classrooms to discussions of God. Besieged teachers and others may increasingly find themselves on the spot to defend evolution and refute creationism. The arguments that creationists use are typically specious and based on misunderstandings of (or outright lies about) evolution, but the number and diversity of the objections can put even well-informed people at a disadvantage. To help with answering them, the following list rebuts some of the most common ""scientific"" arguments raised against evolution. It also directs readers to further sources for information and explains why creation science has no place in the classroom. 1. Evolution is only a theory. It is not a fact or a scientific law. Many people learned in elementary school that a theory falls in the middle of a hierarchy of certainty--above a mere hypothesis but below a law. Scientists do not use the terms that way, however. According to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), a scientific theory is ""a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws, inferences, and tested hypotheses."" No amount of validation changes a theory into a law, which is a descriptive generalization about nature. So when scientists talk about the theory of evolution--or the atomic theory or the theory of relativity, for that matter--they are not expressing reservations about its truth. In addition to the theory of evolution, meaning the idea of descent with modification, one may also speak of the fact of evolution. The NAS defines a fact as ""an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as 'true.'"" The fossil record and abundant other evidence testify that organisms have evolved through time. Although no one observed those transformations, the indirect evidence is clear, unambiguous and compelling. All sciences frequently rely on indirect evidence. Physicists cannot see subatomic particles directly, for instance, so they verify their existence by watching for telltale tracks that the particles leave in cloud chambers. The absence of direct observation does not make physicists' conclusions less certain. 2. Natural selection is based on circular reasoning: the fittest are those who survive, and those who survive are deemed fittest. ""Survival of the fittest"" is a conversational way to describe natural selection, but a more technical description speaks of differential rates of survival and reproduction. That is, rather than labeling species as more or less fit, one can describe how many offspring they are likely to leave under given circumstances. Drop a fast-breeding pair of small-beaked finches and a slower-breeding pair of large-beaked finches onto an island full of food seeds. Within a few generations the fast breeders may control more of the food resources. Yet if large beaks more easily crush seeds, the advantage may tip to the slow breeders. In a pioneering study of finches on the GalÃ¡pagos Islands, Peter R. Grant of Princeton University observed these kinds of population shifts in the wild [see his article ""Natural Selection and Darwin's Finches""; Scientific American, October 1991]. The key is that adaptive fitness can be defined without reference to survival: large beaks are better adapted for crushing seeds, irrespective of whether that trait has survival value under the circumstances. 3. Evolution is unscientific, because it is not testable or falsifiable. It makes claims about events that were not observed and can never be re-created. This blanket dismissal of evolution ignores important distinctions that divide the field into at least two broad areas: microevolution and macroevolution. Microevolution looks at changes within species over time--changes that may be preludes to speciation, the origin of new species. Macroevolution studies how taxonomic groups above the level of species change. Its evidence draws frequently from the fossil record and DNA comparisons to reconstruct how various organisms may be related. These days even most creationists acknowledge that microevolution has been upheld by tests in the laboratory (as in studies of cells, plants and fruit flies) and in the field (as in Grant's studies of evolving beak shapes among GalÂ¿pagos finches). Natural selection and other mechanisms--such as chromosomal changes, symbiosis and hybridization--can drive profound changes in populations over time. The historical nature of macroevolutionary study involves inference from fossils and DNA rather than direct observation. Yet in the historical sciences (which include astronomy, geology and archaeology, as well as evolutionary biology), hypotheses can still be tested by checking whether they accord with physical evidence and whether they lead to verifiable predictions about future discoveries. For instance, evolution implies that between the earliest-known ancestors of humans (roughly five million years old) and the appearance of anatomically modern humans (about 100,000 years ago), one should find a succession of hominid creatures with features progressively less apelike and more modern, which is indeed what the fossil record shows. But one should not--and does not--find modern human fossils embedded in strata from the Jurassic period (144 million years ago). Evolutionary biology routinely makes predictions far more refined and precise than this, and researchers test them constantly. Evolution could be disproved in other ways, too. If we could document the spontaneous generation of just one complex life-form from inanimate matter, then at least a few creatures seen in the fossil record might have originated this way. If superintelligent aliens appeared and claimed credit for creating life on earth (or even particular species), the purely evolutionary explanation would be cast in doubt. But no one has yet produced such evidence. It should be noted that the idea of falsifiability as the defining characteristic of science originated with philosopher Karl Popper in the 1930s. More recent elaborations on his thinking have expanded the narrowest interpretation of his principle precisely because it would eliminate too many branches of clearly scientific endeavor."
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/15-answers-to-creationist/,1,"4. Increasingly, scientists doubt the truth of evolution. No evidence suggests that evolution is losing adherents. Pick up any issue of a peer-reviewed biological journal, and you will find articles that support and extend evolutionary studies or that embrace evolution as a fundamental concept. Conversely, serious scientific publications disputing evolution are all but nonexistent. In the mid-1990s George W. Gilchrist of the University of Washington surveyed thousands of journals in the primary literature, seeking articles on intelligent design or creation science. Among those hundreds of thousands of scientific reports, he found none. In the past two years, surveys done independently by Barbara Forrest of Southeastern Louisiana University and Lawrence M. Krauss of Case Western Reserve University have been similarly fruitless. Creationists retort that a closed-minded scientific community rejects their evidence. Yet according to the editors of Nature, Science and other leading journals, few antievolution manuscripts are even submitted. Some antievolution authors have published papers in serious journals. Those papers, however, rarely attack evolution directly or advance creationist arguments; at best, they identify certain evolutionary problems as unsolved and difficult (which no one disputes). In short, creationists are not giving the scientific world good reason to take them seriously. 5. The disagreements among even evolutionary biologists show how little solid science supports evolution. Evolutionary biologists passionately debate diverse topics: how speciation happens, the rates of evolutionary change, the ancestral relationships of birds and dinosaurs, whether Neandertals were a species apart from modern humans, and much more. These disputes are like those found in all other branches of science. Acceptance of evolution as a factual occurrence and a guiding principle is nonetheless universal in biology. Unfortunately, dishonest creationists have shown a willingness to take scientists' comments out of context to exaggerate and distort the disagreements. Anyone acquainted with the works of paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard University knows that in addition to co-authoring the punctuated-equilibrium model, Gould was one of the most eloquent defenders and articulators of evolution. (Punctuated equilibrium explains patterns in the fossil record by suggesting that most evolutionary changes occur within geologically brief intervals--which may nonetheless amount to hundreds of generations.) Yet creationists delight in dissecting out phrases from Gould's voluminous prose to make him sound as though he had doubted evolution, and they present punctuated equilibrium as though it allows new species to materialize overnight or birds to be born from reptile eggs. When confronted with a quotation from a scientific authority that seems to question evolution, insist on seeing the statement in context. Almost invariably, the attack on evolution will prove illusory. 6. If humans descended from monkeys, why are there still monkeys? This surprisingly common argument reflects several levels of ignorance about evolution. The first mistake is that evolution does not teach that humans descended from monkeys; it states that both have a common ancestor. The deeper error is that this objection is tantamount to asking, ""If children descended from adults, why are there still adults?"" New species evolve by splintering off from established ones, when populations of organisms become isolated from the main branch of their family and acquire sufficient differences to remain forever distinct. The parent species may survive indefinitely thereafter, or it may become extinct. 7. Evolution cannot explain how life first appeared on earth. The origin of life remains very much a mystery, but biochemists have learned about how primitive nucleic acids, amino acids and other building blocks of life could have formed and organized themselves into self-replicating, self-sustaining units, laying the foundation for cellular biochemistry. Astrochemical analyses hint that quantities of these compounds might have originated in space and fallen to earth in comets, a scenario that may solve the problem of how those constituents arose under the conditions that prevailed when our planet was young. Creationists sometimes try to invalidate all of evolution by pointing to science's current inability to explain the origin of life. But even if life on earth turned out to have a nonevolutionary origin (for instance, if aliens introduced the first cells billions of years ago), evolution since then would be robustly confirmed by countless microevolutionary and macroevolutionary studies. 8. Mathematically, it is inconceivable that anything as complex as a protein, let alone a living cell or a human, could spring up by chance. Chance plays a part in evolution (for example, in the random mutations that can give rise to new traits), but evolution does not depend on chance to create organisms, proteins or other entities. Quite the opposite: natural selection, the principal known mechanism of evolution, harnesses nonrandom change by preserving ""desirable"" (adaptive) features and eliminating ""undesirable"" (nonadaptive) ones. As long as the forces of selection stay constant, natural selection can push evolution in one direction and produce sophisticated structures in surprisingly short times. As an analogy, consider the 13-letter sequence ""TOBEORNOTTOBE."" Those hypothetical million monkeys, each pecking out one phrase a second, could take as long as 78,800 years to find it among the 2613 sequences of that length. But in the 1980s Richard Hardison of Glendale College wrote a computer program that generated phrases randomly while preserving the positions of individual letters that happened to be correctly placed (in effect, selecting for phrases more like Hamlet's). On average, the program re-created the phrase in just 336 iterations, less than 90 seconds. Even more amazing, it could reconstruct Shakespeare's entire play in just four and a half days."
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/15-answers-to-creationist/,1,"9. The Second Law of Thermodynamics says that systems must become more disordered over time. Living cells therefore could not have evolved from inanimate chemicals, and multicellular life could not have evolved from protozoa. This argument derives from a misunderstanding of the Second Law. If it were valid, mineral crystals and snowflakes would also be impossible, because they, too, are complex structures that form spontaneously from disordered parts. The Second Law actually states that the total entropy of a closed system (one that no energy or matter leaves or enters) cannot decrease. Entropy is a physical concept often casually described as disorder, but it differs significantly from the conversational use of the word. More important, however, the Second Law permits parts of a system to decrease in entropy as long as other parts experience an offsetting increase. Thus, our planet as a whole can grow more complex because the sun pours heat and light onto it, and the greater entropy associated with the sun's nuclear fusion more than rebalances the scales. Simple organisms can fuel their rise toward complexity by consuming other forms of life and nonliving materials. 10. Mutations are essential to evolution theory, but mutations can only eliminate traits. They cannot produce new features. On the contrary, biology has catalogued many traits produced by point mutations (changes at precise positions in an organism's DNA)--bacterial resistance to antibiotics, for example. Mutations that arise in the homeobox (Hox) family of development-regulating genes in animals can also have complex effects. Hox genes direct where legs, wings, antennae and body segments should grow. In fruit flies, for instance, the mutation called Antennapedia causes legs to sprout where antennae should grow. These abnormal limbs are not functional, but their existence demonstrates that genetic mistakes can produce complex structures, which natural selection can then test for possible uses. Moreover, molecular biology has discovered mechanisms for genetic change that go beyond point mutations, and these expand the ways in which new traits can appear. Functional modules within genes can be spliced together in novel ways. Whole genes can be accidentally duplicated in an organism's DNA, and the duplicates are free to mutate into genes for new, complex features. Comparisons of the DNA from a wide variety of organisms indicate that this is how the globin family of blood proteins evolved over millions of years. 11. Natural selection might explain microevolution, but it cannot explain the origin of new species and higher orders of life. Evolutionary biologists have written extensively about how natural selection could produce new species. For instance, in the model called allopatry, developed by Ernst Mayr of Harvard University, if a population of organisms were isolated from the rest of its species by geographical boundaries, it might be subjected to different selective pressures. Changes would accumulate in the isolated population. If those changes became so significant that the splinter group could not or routinely would not breed with the original stock, then the splinter group would be reproductively isolated and on its way toward becoming a new species. Natural selection is the best studied of the evolutionary mechanisms, but biologists are open to other possibilities as well. Biologists are constantly assessing the potential of unusual genetic mechanisms for causing speciation or for producing complex features in organisms. Lynn Margulis of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and others have persuasively argued that some cellular organelles, such as the energy-generating mitochondria, evolved through the symbiotic merger of ancient organisms. Thus, science welcomes the possibility of evolution resulting from forces beyond natural selection. Yet those forces must be natural; they cannot be attributed to the actions of mysterious creative intelligences whose existence, in scientific terms, is unproved. 12. Nobody has ever seen a new species evolve. Speciation is probably fairly rare and in many cases might take centuries. Furthermore, recognizing a new species during a formative stage can be difficult, because biologists sometimes disagree about how best to define a species. The most widely used definition, Mayr's Biological Species Concept, recognizes a species as a distinct community of reproductively isolated populations--sets of organisms that normally do not or cannot breed outside their community. In practice, this standard can be difficult to apply to organisms isolated by distance or terrain or to plants (and, of course, fossils do not breed). Biologists therefore usually use organisms' physical and behavioral traits as clues to their species membership. Nevertheless, the scientific literature does contain reports of apparent speciation events in plants, insects and worms. In most of these experiments, researchers subjected organisms to various types of selection--for anatomical differences, mating behaviors, habitat preferences and other traits--and found that they had created populations of organisms that did not breed with outsiders. For example, William R. Rice of the University of New Mexico and George W. Salt of the University of California at Davis demonstrated that if they sorted a group of fruit flies by their preference for certain environments and bred those flies separately over 35 generations, the resulting flies would refuse to breed with those from a very different environment. 13. Evolutionists cannot point to any transitional fossils--creatures that are half reptile and half bird, for instance. Actually, paleontologists know of many detailed examples of fossils intermediate in form between various taxonomic groups. One of the most famous fossils of all time is Archaeopteryx, which combines feathers and skeletal structures peculiar to birds with features of dinosaurs. A flock's worth of other feathered fossil species, some more avian and some less, has also been found. A sequence of fossils spans the evolution of modern horses from the tiny Eohippus. Whales had four-legged ancestors that walked on land, and creatures known as Ambulocetus and Rodhocetus helped to make that transition [see ""The Mammals That Conquered the Seas,"" by Kate Wong; Scientific American, May]. Fossil seashells trace the evolution of various mollusks through millions of years. Perhaps 20 or more hominids (not all of them our ancestors) fill the gap between Lucy the australopithecine and modern humans. Creationists, though, dismiss these fossil studies. They argue that Archaeopteryx is not a missing link between reptiles and birds--it is just an extinct bird with reptilian features. They want evolutionists to produce a weird, chimeric monster that cannot be classified as belonging to any known group. Even if a creationist does accept a fossil as transitional between two species, he or she may then insist on seeing other fossils intermediate between it and the first two. These frustrating requests can proceed ad infinitum and place an unreasonable burden on the always incomplete fossil record."
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/15-answers-to-creationist/,1,"Nevertheless, evolutionists can cite further supportive evidence from molecular biology. All organisms share most of the same genes, but as evolution predicts, the structures of these genes and their products diverge among species, in keeping with their evolutionary relationships. Geneticists speak of the ""molecular clock"" that records the passage of time. These molecular data also show how various organisms are transitional within evolution. 14. Living things have fantastically intricate features--at the anatomical, cellular and molecular levels--that could not function if they were any less complex or sophisticated. The only prudent conclusion is that they are the products of intelligent design, not evolution. This ""argument from design"" is the backbone of most recent attacks on evolution, but it is also one of the oldest. In 1802 theologian William Paley wrote that if one finds a pocket watch in a field, the most reasonable conclusion is that someone dropped it, not that natural forces created it there. By analogy, Paley argued, the complex structures of living things must be the handiwork of direct, divine invention. Darwin wrote On the Origin of Species as an answer to Paley: he explained how natural forces of selection, acting on inherited features, could gradually shape the evolution of ornate organic structures. Generations of creationists have tried to counter Darwin by citing the example of the eye as a structure that could not have evolved. The eye's ability to provide vision depends on the perfect arrangement of its parts, these critics say. Natural selection could thus never favor the transitional forms needed during the eye's evolution--what good is half an eye? Anticipating this criticism, Darwin suggested that even ""incomplete"" eyes might confer benefits (such as helping creatures orient toward light) and thereby survive for further evolutionary refinement. Biology has vindicated Darwin: researchers have identified primitive eyes and light-sensing organs throughout the animal kingdom and have even tracked the evolutionary history of eyes through comparative genetics. (It now appears that in various families of organisms, eyes have evolved independently.) Today's intelligent-design advocates are more sophisticated than their predecessors, but their arguments and goals are not fundamentally different. They criticize evolution by trying to demonstrate that it could not account for life as we know it and then insist that the only tenable alternative is that life was designed by an unidentified intelligence. 15. Recent discoveries prove that even at the microscopic level, life has a quality of complexity that could not have come about through evolution. ""Irreducible complexity"" is the battle cry of Michael J. Behe of Lehigh University, author of Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution. As a household example of irreducible complexity, Behe chooses the mousetrap--a machine that could not function if any of its pieces were missing and whose pieces have no value except as parts of the whole. What is true of the mousetrap, he says, is even truer of the bacterial flagellum, a whiplike cellular organelle used for propulsion that operates like an outboard motor. The proteins that make up a flagellum are uncannily arranged into motor components, a universal joint and other structures like those that a human engineer might specify. The possibility that this intricate array could have arisen through evolutionary modification is virtually nil, Behe argues, and that bespeaks intelligent design. He makes similar points about the blood's clotting mechanism and other molecular systems. Yet evolutionary biologists have answers to these objections. First, there exist flagellae with forms simpler than the one that Behe cites, so it is not necessary for all those components to be present for a flagellum to work. The sophisticated components of this flagellum all have precedents elsewhere in nature, as described by Kenneth R. Miller of Brown University and others. In fact, the entire flagellum assembly is extremely similar to an organelle that Yersinia pestis, the bubonic plague bacterium, uses to inject toxins into cells. The key is that the flagellum's component structures, which Behe suggests have no value apart from their role in propulsion, can serve multiple functions that would have helped favor their evolution. The final evolution of the flagellum might then have involved only the novel recombination of sophisticated parts that initially evolved for other purposes. Similarly, the blood-clotting system seems to involve the modification and elaboration of proteins that were originally used in digestion, according to studies by Russell F. Doolittle of the University of California at San Diego. So some of the complexity that Behe calls proof of intelligent design is not irreducible at all. Complexity of a different kind--""specified complexity""--is the cornerstone of the intelligent-design arguments of William A. Dembski of Baylor University in his books The Design Inference and No Free Lunch. Essentially his argument is that living things are complex in a way that undirected, random processes could never produce. The only logical conclusion, Dembski asserts, in an echo of Paley 200 years ago, is that some superhuman intelligence created and shaped life. Dembski's argument contains several holes. It is wrong to insinuate that the field of explanations consists only of random processes or designing intelligences. Researchers into nonlinear systems and cellular automata at the Santa Fe Institute and elsewhere have demonstrated that simple, undirected processes can yield extraordinarily complex patterns. Some of the complexity seen in organisms may therefore emerge through natural phenomena that we as yet barely understand. But that is far different from saying that the complexity could not have arisen naturally. ""Creation science"" is a contradiction in terms. A central tenet of modern science is methodological naturalism--it seeks to explain the universe purely in terms of observed or testable natural mechanisms. Thus, physics describes the atomic nucleus with specific concepts governing matter and energy, and it tests those descriptions experimentally. Physicists introduce new particles, such as quarks, to flesh out their theories only when data show that the previous descriptions cannot adequately explain observed phenomena. The new particles do not have arbitrary properties, moreover--their definitions are tightly constrained, because the new particles must fit within the existing framework of physics. In contrast, intelligent-design theorists invoke shadowy entities that conveniently have whatever unconstrained abilities are needed to solve the mystery at hand. Rather than expanding scientific inquiry, such answers shut it down. (How does one disprove the existence of omnipotent intelligences?) Intelligent design offers few answers. For instance, when and how did a designing intelligence intervene in life's history? By creating the first DNA? The first cell? The first human? Was every species designed, or just a few early ones? Proponents of intelligent-design theory frequently decline to be pinned down on these points. They do not even make real attempts to reconcile their disparate ideas about intelligent design. Instead they pursue argument by exclusion--that is, they belittle evolutionary explanations as far-fetched or incomplete and then imply that only design-based alternatives remain. Logically, this is misleading: even if one naturalistic explanation is flawed, it does not mean that all are. Moreover, it does not make one intelligent-design theory more reasonable than another. Listeners are essentially left to fill in the blanks for themselves, and some will undoubtedly do so by substituting their religious beliefs for scientific ideas. Time and again, science has shown that methodological naturalism can push back ignorance, finding increasingly detailed and informative answers to mysteries that once seemed impenetrable: the nature of light, the causes of disease, how the brain works. Evolution is doing the same with the riddle of how the living world took shape. Creationism, by any name, adds nothing of intellectual value to the effort."
http://infidels.org/library/modern/mark_vuletic/defense_of_evolution.html,1,"Introduction[1] The world presents to us vast evidence confirming the evolutionary history of life, and nothing even remotely resembling a disproof of it. This is an inexplicable mystery if, as creationists insist, God created the variety of life through a means other than evolution. Had God done so, it would scarcely be possible for the world not to abound with clear evidence decisively refuting evolution; it would, in fact, be possible only if God deliberately rearranged the world after creation to make it look as though evolution had occurred, so that His poor subjects might be misled and thereby condemn themselves to an eternity in Hell. In other words, assuming God exists in the first place, either He used evolution as His means of creating the diversity of life on Earth, or else He is an abhorrent liar and deceiver--titles which have traditionally been reserved for the Devil. What are some of the places where creationists should expect to find a smoking gun against evolution?[2] The Fossil Record One of the crucial predictions of evolutionary theory is that one should find a general progression of increasingly diverse and complex life forms when one traces the fossil record through progressively higher strata of sedimentary rock. This is not to say that major extinctions cannot occur, or that simpler life forms cannot persist alongside more complex ones, but merely that the more complex ones should not appear before the less complex ones have appeared.[3] The appearance of organisms in the fossil record should reflect the branching, treelike structure of evolution. Thus, had God wished to supply humanity with decisive evidence refuting evolution, He could have done so easily by depositing, preserving, and later exposing to paleontologists numerous mammalian fossils in the oldest rock strata (no difficult feat for the omnipotent creator of the universe). In fact, had God desired, He could have inverted the entire sequence of fossils with no more than a twitch of His little toe, placing all of the fossils of austalopithecines and rhinosceri in the oldest strata, and every last vestige of blue-green algae in the newest. Yet, when we examine the fossil record, we find a distribution that matches the predictions of evolution, not one of the countless distributions that would not. Creationist spokesmen are forced to seize upon any ad hoc explanation they can think of to explain this; for instance, that Noah's Flood somehow sorted the fossils into exactly the pattern expected by evolution, or that God, for some strange reason, decided to create life over the course of aeons in a sequence matching the predictions of evolution (in either case, God presumably did not care that the resultant fossil patterns would cause us to be deceived). Surely it is more sensible simply to conclude that evolution has occurred."
http://infidels.org/library/modern/mark_vuletic/defense_of_evolution.html,1,"A second prediction of evolution is that the fossil record should yield transitional forms. Evolution does not require the fossil record to yield transitional forms as plentiful as the stars, since the conditions of fossilization are severe, and some organisms fossilize less easily than others, but one would reasonably become suspicious if, after more than a century of work, paleontologists had not discovered any transitional forms at all. A complete absence of transitional forms, in fact, is precisely what creationists should expect. Paleontology, however, has yielded plentiful transitional forms, of which a mere handful is listed here: From fish to amphibian: The fish Eusthenopteron and the early amphibian Icthyostega share so many characteristics as to constitute a virtual bridge between fishes and amphibians. From amphibian to reptile: Seymouria, according to Alfred Romer, ""exhibits such a combination of amphibian and reptilian characters that its proper position in the classification of vertebrates has been much disputed"" (Romer 1966:94). From reptile to bird: Archaeopteryx displays a distinct blend of major reptilian and avian characteristics, and highly resembles the theropod reptiles of its time. From reptile to mammal: Probelesedon and Massetognathus exhibit both reptilian and mammalian characteristics. Probainognathus even has two sets of jaw joints (one reptilian and one mammalian). From hominid to human: The transition from our ""ape-like"" ancestors to us is so well documented in the fossil record, with so many fossil forms so clearly intermediate that, as Jim Foley has shown, even creationists cannot agree with one another about which ones are purely human and which ones are purely ape (Foley 2005). Such confusion, of course, is exactly what we would expect if the fossils truly are intermediates. If we look to some of the less prominent transitions in life, we find equally astounding transitional forms. For instance, evolutionists have hypothesized that whales evolved from ancient ungulates.[4] Since the ungulates include such creatures as cattle, camels, and hippopotami, this is a hypothesis which many creationists have ridiculed, and virtually all have thought implausible. However, there is ample evidence for the transition in fossils ranging from Pakicetus (a land creature that does not look like a whale at all but has an ear region and teeth resembling that of fossil whales) to Ambulocetus (an intermediate with well-developed legs, capable of motion on land, but better suited to an aquatic life) to Basilosaurus (a primitive whale with small hind legs), demonstrating a full range of transitional characteristics between land-going creatures and whales. Given that creatures such as these, which creationists expect not to exist at all, exhibit obvious transitional characteristics and exist in the places and time periods in which evolutionists expect to find them, we again have no option but to conclude either that evolution took place, whether through God's design or not, or else that God created all of these creatures directly, transitional characteristics and all, so that man might be deceived into rejecting the true history of creation. Patterns in Genetic Material Had God created life through means other than evolution, He could have used the faintest whisper of His boundless power to endow each kind of creature with a different form of genetic material, or a completely different genetic code. But all life forms on Earth use DNA and RNA as genetic material, with a code that admits of only very rare and insignificant alterations, which is what one would expect had all life evolved from a common ancestor."
http://infidels.org/library/modern/mark_vuletic/defense_of_evolution.html,1,"There is, furthermore, a high degree of correspondence between molecular phylogenies and evolutionary expectations, even for nonfunctional changes in DNA. Especially puzzling for creationism is the question of why these evolutionary expectations are borne out in the case of similar species living in similar climates on different continents: creationists should expect the DNA of such creatures to closely match, if DNA was designed for functionality. However, we find instead that these species often have DNA more closely resembling that of different species in adjacent environments than that of the similar species in distant locales. The appearance of the similar species is the result of convergent evolution: the species have managed to adapt in similar ways to their environments, but they remain genetically closer to the different species near them, with whom they share a more recent common ancestor. The manner in which such genetic correlations match evolutionary expectations is independent confirmation of evolution that would serve absolutely no purpose but deception in a world in which all life was created directly by God. Evolution and Atheism? Sometimes, especially when addressing religious audiences (from whom they draw the most funding and political clout), creationist spokesmen drop their scientific pretenses and reveal their narrow religious motivations by attacking evolution as atheistic. These creationists would have one believe that evolution presupposes and promotes atheism simply because it contradicts their particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis. Apparently they have decreed through their own infallible, godlike powers, that their human interpretation of Genesis is infallible, and that all who disagree with them must therefore be atheists and enemies of religion, or at least the unthinking dupes of such sinister forces, which they alone have had the moral and intellectual fortitude to resist. Evolution, however, poses no special problem for the religious believer; most evolutionists have no problem reconciling their scientific knowledge with their belief in God. Creationist leaders attempt to frighten the believers they address by pointing to atheistic evolutionists such as zoologist Richard Dawkins (1986), philosopher Daniel C. Dennett (1995), and historian William Provine. Seldom, however, do they seem to mention believing evolutionists such cell biologist Kenneth R. Miller (1999), theologian James F. Haught (2001), or philosopher Robert T. Pennock (1999). They ignore statements by church assemblies supporting evolution.[5] Nor do they point out polls that show that a full 40% of scientists believe that a god guided the process of evolution (Witham 2002:54). Even many of those who believe that evolution proceeds without divine input simply do not understand what evolution is supposed to have to do with whether or not God created the universe, whether or not He forgives us our sins, or whether or not He was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected. While it is true that evolution knocks down one traditional argument for the existence of God (the argument from biological design) there are still plenty of other arguments left over upon which evolution has no bearing. Apparently, what creationist spokesmen really mean when they aver that evolution is atheistic, is that evolution is incompatible with the exact doctrines which they have chosen to enshrine as infallible. Most people, however, consider it rather arrogant to declare that any deviation from your personal interpretation of a religious text amounts to atheism. But isn't the wastefulness and arbitrariness of evolution incompatible with the existence of God? Atheists, naturally enough, tend to think so; but for the believer, the wastefulness and arbitrariness of evolution can present no special problem not already presented by the events of everyday life. Consider, for instance, the wastefulness and arbitrariness present in the rape and murder of a child: on the one hand, a person who is inclined to view such things as incompatible with the existence of a loving god is already at the doorstep of atheism, and will hardly be moved by the comparative tameness of the evolutionary history of life. On the other hand, it would be a sick joke beyond measure to suggest that anyone capable of genuflecting at the altar of God after considering the rape and murder of a child could possibly have his or her faith shaken by the cruelty of the evolutionary process. As far as the matter of atheism versus theism goes, the wastefulness and arbitrariness of evolution is either redundant or irrelevant. The Bible and Creationism Creationist leaders conclude from their interpretation of the Book of Genesis that evolution cannot have occurred. However, in doing so they presuppose that their personal interpretative powers are infallible. In asserting that God must have inspired the creation stories in Genesis, that He could not have inspired mythological creation stories for any purpose, and that He could not have meant for the creation stories in question to be interpreted in any other way than that which the creationist leader finds most intuitive, these creationists seem to place very severe constraints upon what God can and cannot do. Stranger still, these typically are the same people who loudly berate evolutionists for supposedly trusting human reason over the word of God. These creationists do not seem to realize that their judgement that Genesis is the word of God, and their judgement about how Genesis is to be interpreted, both are products of their own distinctly human reasoning. To reason is inescapable, whether there is a god or not."
http://infidels.org/library/modern/mark_vuletic/defense_of_evolution.html,1,"Hence, instead of immediately declaring our first impressions about the Book of Genesis to be infallible, and then refusing to budge regardless of evidence, let us not be afraid to embrace the faculty of reasoning which, if God exists, can have come from no one but Him. Let us consider what our most cautious scholarship tells us at this point about the creation stories in the Book of Genesis. The current consensus among biblical scholars regarding the first five books of the Bible is embodied in what is known as the Documentary Hypothesis. For the purposes of our discussion, we need only note that the Documentary Hypothesis detects the hands of four distinct authors (or sets of authors) in the Book of Genesis; these authors are abbreviated to J, P, E, and R, for reasons we need not get into. According to Richard Elliott Friedman, P is responsible for the first creation story in Genesis, which runs from 1:1 to 2:3, and J is responsible for the second one, which runs from 2:4b to 25 (Friedman 1996:246). When P wrote his account, he was apparently familiar with, and in fact following a synthesis of, J and E (JE) which contained the J creation story (Friedman 1996:188). But P was intended as an alternative to, not a supplement of, JE (Friedman 1996:188-206). A later editor (R) fused together the JE and P accounts while adding a few sentences of his own. If you have ever noticed how uneasily Genesis 1:1-2:3 and Genesis 2:4-2:30 sit together, and how different they sound from one another, this is why: they are, in fact, two distinct creation stories, the former being written as a later alternative to the latter.[6] It is, of course, always possible with sufficient ingenuity to interpret any two passages of any two texts so that they form a single narrative, and this is the standard strategy among creationists with respect to the J and P creation stories. The question is whether this is the right strategy. Supposing God had wished to give us the one true account of creation, and that it was an important matter for salvation, why would He give what creationists consider the first part of the story to J, later give what creationists consider the second part of the story to P (even though P was trying to write something to replace JE), and then leave it to the human ingenuity of R to later fuse the two accounts together as well as he could? If it were important to God that intelligent people believe the creationist interpretation of Genesis, wouldn't He give the entire account to a single person all at once (like to Moses, as tradition has it)? Instead, we are left with a process that has all of the hallmarks of human political maneuvering and none of the appearance of inspiration by God. The problem is exacerbated when we notice that some of the statements in Genesis directly contradict modern science beyond evolution. Genesis 1, for instance, places waters above the stars, and has the Earth, grass, herbs, and fruit trees existing before both the sun and the stars. Of course, if we have decided in advance to fit the words of Genesis to the findings of modern science by any means possible, we can certainly make the fit. However, given that every religious person denies the rationality of this method when people of other religions use it to demonstrate the truth of their holy texts, accepting such a method when considering one's own holy text would be hypocritical. If we refuse to embrace this double-standard, then we must concede that the Genesis creation stories have the appearance of pre-scientific mythology. Therefore, again, if the creation stories of Genesis were inspired by God in the first place, it is apparent that they were not likely intended by Him to offer an entirely true account of creation. What, then, could their function be, if they were inspired by God? I can only speculate. Perhaps they were meant to give the ancient Jews another strong element of culture to rally to in times of crisis. The Jewish people and national identity have survived through conditions in which countless others have been destroyed or assimilated, and their shared creation myths may be part of the reason why. Perhaps these myths have served their purpose, and were never meant to be collected into a book and preached as infallible truth forever. I do not know; I am not a theologian, nor even a believer, and am personally content to accept the stories as myths in which no god had a hand. But were I a believer, I would see some wisdom in the old dictum that Scripture tells us how to go to Heaven, not how the heavens go. I would recognize that I would still have faults and shortcomings even if there had been no historical Adam and Eve to somehow pass their own sinfulness to their descendants. I would recognize that the arrival of a Messiah, or the return of a once-resurrected one, would be no less possible even if God never said ""Let there be light."" And I would recognize, above all, that to insist upon binding God to one's first impression of a text, disregarding His gift of reason, would be a sign of arrogance rather than piety. Conclusion To the rational believer, science is a means of using the God-given gift of reason to understand how God has actually done things. At one point in history, believers used to think that the Sun revolved around the Earth, because they thought the Bible revealed this infallible truth. Science, however, revealed that the Earth revolves around the Sun. Although some believers resisted this discovery bitterly at first, mistaking their own interpretations for the infallible word of God, virtually all eventually came to understand that God simply could not have set things up the way they had thought. Now few believers think the Bible contains such a teaching at all. While believers will find the scientific view of the world enhanced and enriched by their religious beliefs, it is sheer folly to insist upon a point of doctrine, grounded in intuition and the authority of tradition, when scientific evidence indicates its falsity. The time will hopefully come when the creationists, like the geocentrists of old, set aside their dogmas and follow the light of reason so that they, too, may learn the great wonders science teaches of the universe, and, if He exists, of God.[7]"
http://www.rogerdarlington.me.uk/evolution.html,1,"THE NEED FOR THIS ESSAY There can be few more intriguing and important scientific questions than: what is the origin of humankind? When I was a boy at a Roman Catholic school in the early 1960s, I had to learn the Catechism and essentially this offered a three-word answer to the question which was: â€œGod made meâ€. I soon came to believe that this answer was as wrong as it was inadequate. However, surveys repeatedly show that about 40% of Americans hold to the creationist view that God made human beings much in their present form at one time in the last 10,000 years. It would appear that around 20% of Britons believe something similar. The problem is that, once one moves beyond mere faith to look at the scientific arguments, the alternative explanation to creationism (or its cousin intelligent design) â€“ namely, evolution â€“ is a complicated matter and few people have the desire or the time or the understanding to study the case for evolution. Consequently there are very few brief, accurate and intelligible pieces of writing on the origins of humankind. This essay attempts to address that gap. WHAT IS EVOLUTION? Before setting out the evidence for evolution and considering some of the arguments advanced against it, it would be as well to have a clear understanding of what is meant by the biological term 'evolution'. The theory of evolution was independently developed by Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, but it was the latter who first set out the case in book form in his ""On The Origin of Species"" which was first published in 1859. In that book, humans were barely mentioned. It was only in ""The Descent Of Man"" published in 1871 that he spelled out how humankind too was the subject of evolution and shared an ancestor with the chimpanzee. Evolution therefore is an explanation for the origin of all life forms or species: bacteria, fungi, plants, animals, humans. It holds that all life forms have the same origin and that one form of life evolves into another through a process known as natural selection. How does this work? All life forms comprise cells which undergo a process of division. This process is subject to mutations â€“ slight changes in genetic composition â€“ which occur randomly. Most mutations are neutral or disadvantageous rather than potentially beneficial, if only because they are random and there are many more ways of becoming worse than of becoming better. Nature selects for preference those random mutations which confer on that life form a greater chance of survival and reproduction. The mutation might be a different shaped beak or a longer neck that makes it easier to access local foods or markings that make it less detectable to predators (effectively â€˜camouflagingâ€™ it) or faster speed to make it more able to outrun predators. Where one population is isolated from another (that is, they cannot interbreed), species can and do develop different characteristics reflecting the local circumstances in terms of geography, climate, prey, predators and food supply. This was how Darwin noticed differences in types of finch and tortoise on the GalÃ¡pagos islands. The process has been dubbed 'the survival of the fittest' although this was not a term which originated with Darwin himself. Since this idea has been hijacked by so-called social Darwinists, it is important to understand that the term 'fittest' is not a value judgement but simply a measure of the likelihood of having living offspring â€“ that is, the ability to survive and the ability to reproduce - and the process applies to individual life forms - such as an individual animal - and not to groups of life forms â€“ such as Caucasian humans. So 'the survival of the fittest' is perhaps better expressed as the survival of the â€˜best adaptedâ€™ to a given environment. Although Darwin himself did not know this, the biological means by which these mutations conferring advantage are passed from one generation to another is particular genes in a gene pool. A gene is a length of DNA which is deoxribonucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of (virtually) all known living organisms. The process of natural selection is incredibly slow in terms of human life spans, but there has been plenty of time for natural selection to work, since the Earth is around 4.6 billion years old, self-replicating molecules emerged around 3.5 billion years ago, simple clusters of cells appeared about 800 million years ago, and the common ancestor of chimpanzees, gorillas and humans lived around 6-7 million years ago. So, in the natural world (as opposed to a breeding centre or a laboratory), changes - such as a longer neck or a faster speed or a larger brain - take a long time to evolve, so long that one cannot identify the point at which one species actually becomes another. Natural selection can appear wasteful and cruel. Most species have not survived various mass extinctions. The most famous is the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction of some 65 million years ago which resulted in the death of the dinosaurs. But the most devastating was during the Permian-Triassic period some 250 million years ago when 70% of land vertebrates and 96% of marine species were lost. Today, as throughout evolution, most animals die young and painfully either through starvation or predation. It really is a brutal competition for survival with the fittest most likely to survive and pass its genes on to the next generation. But it is vital to appreciate that this is not a plan or a design. It is an automatic process of natural selection by random mutation. If there were no such process at work, we would not be here to consider it. Link: the process of natural selection as described by the Khan Academy click here NINE ARGUMENTS FOR EVOLUTION Argument 1: Evolution explains the similarity of species Like any good scientific theory or law, evolution explains all the known facts in a consistent and convincing manner. Most especially, it explains convincingly how present day species are related to each other."
http://www.rogerdarlington.me.uk/evolution.html,1,"It explains the similarity â€“ the technical term is homology â€“ between the skeletons of all mammals, which share the same 28 bones although in different proportions, and how mammals have many similarities with other vertebrates including the basic features of their skeletons and their digestive, circulatory and nervous systems. It explains why the body plan of all crustaceans â€“ lobsters, prawns, crabs and the like â€“ is the same. It explains why the DNA code is invariant across all living creatures while individual genes vary. Argument 2: Evolution explains the geographical distribution of species Evolution explains why animals tend to live on the same continent as fossils that are probably their ancestors and why animals share the same continent with species that resemble them. Conversely, no frogs are found on oceanic islands because frogspawn is immediately killed by sea water. Particularly striking is the evidence of life on oceanic islands formed by volcanic action and never connected to a continent â€“ such as the GalÃ¡pagos and Hawaiian islands. Evolution suggests that such locations would have few species because of the difficulty of crossing the ocean and that such places would have animal forms that are found nowhere else because the habitat is so distinct. This is exactly what we find: so on the GalÃ¡pagos islands there are only just over 20 species of bird and 14 of those are finches and on the Hawaiian islands the number of species of the fruitfly Drosophila exceeds that found in the rest of the world. Argument 3: Natural selection is analogous with other forms of selection We are reinforced in our view that over time random mutations can through natural selection result in different types of life and different versions of animals because we observe that artificial selection - for instance, of cabbages, roses, pigeons, dogs and horses - and sexual selection - for instance between peahens and peacocks - does the same on a much shorter timescale. Argument 4: Evolution is confirmed by scientific dating methods We know that life has evolved over millions and millions of years and not a few thousand years because of scientific dating techniques such as the decay of radioactive materials and carbon dating. All these dating techniques not only reveal a very long process of evolution but are remarkably consistent in the dates that they offer us. Argument 5: Evolution is confirmed by observation and experimentation The most striking case is the ever-increasing resistance of bacteria to anti-biotics. Bacteria multiply fast and are present in enormous numbers so that mutations that are resistant to a particular anti-biotic can occur easily. The more we use anti-biotics, the faster bacteria can evolve to be resistant to them. Another example is the increased frequency of tuskless elephants because of the killing of elephants for their ivory. The explanation is that the elephants that were not killed for their tusks were more likely to survive and became a growing band proportionally while their offspring with genes that did not produce tusks also had a better chance of survival. In 1971, a type of insect-eating lizard that was present on an island called Pod KopiÅ¡te but not on the island of Pod MrÄaru â€“ both islands being located off the Croatian coast â€“ was transported to the second island where the lizards had a more vegetarian diet. In 2008, scientists found that the descendants of the transported lizards had significantly larger heads because they were eating more plant material. This was natural selection at work over a mere 37 years. [For more information click here] An experiment conducted by the bacteriologist Richard Lenski and his colleagues at Michigan State University in the United States took a common bacterium called Escherichia coli and, through a series of ingenious techniques, replicated the effect of over 50,000 generations of the bacteria. The results were entirely consistent with the principles of natural selection through random mutation. [For more information click here] Argument 6: Evolution is confirmed by the fossil record Very few fossils had been discovered at the time of Darwin's original thesis, but it was clear from the theory that, if evolution is true, fossils of simpler forms of life should be found at earlier or lower levels of strata of the Earth and fossils of more developed forms of life should be discovered in later or higher levels of strata. This is exactly what the fossil record reveals. All fossils which have been found - and there are now very many - are in the correct temporal sequence. No fossil has ever been found in the 'wrong' sequence. Specifically we now have a rich supply of intermediate fossils linking modern humans with the common ancestor that humans share with chimpanzees. You can view for yourself a selection of such fossils in most museums of natural history. Of course, the fossil record is not complete and never could be especially for animals which are not susceptible to being fossilised, but the fossil evidence in many major animal groups is strong and becoming ever stronger. Argument 7: Evolution is confirmed by the gene pool Darwin did not know about genes which were first suggested by the Austrian scientist Gregor Mendel, although Mendel himself did not use the term which was only coined in 1909. A gene is a length of DNA that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all living organisms. As the science of genetics has rapidly developed, we have become capable of mapping the genetic code of different life forms and identifying the incredible similarity in genetic composition of life forms which have common ancestors as explained by evolution. This has enabled geneticists to say that humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genes â€“ although it is important to understand what is meant by such a statement. It does not refer to the number of whole genes but to the number of DNA 'letters' that match each other. The point is that shared DNA is confirmation of shared ancestry as set out in the theory of evolution."
http://www.rogerdarlington.me.uk/evolution.html,1,"Argument 8: There is an absence of design If emergence of life was not the result of a process of natural selection through random mutation, then it might be that it was the result of a non-random process involving design which would suggest a designer (God). In fact, it is clear that there is no design. On the contrary, there many instances of imperfection. A wonderful case occurs with the pouch of the koala bear which opens downwards instead of upwards as in a kangaroo, even though the koala spends its time hanging upright from trees. The explanation - provided by evolution - is that the koala is descended from a wombat-like ancestor who flung soil backwards, necessitating a pouch facing downwards. The most dramatic illustration that life was not designed by a beneficent God is that of the ichneumon wasp which paralyses a caterpillar and then lays eggs inside its body which hatch to produce young which proceed to devour the caterpillar alive one organ after another in an order which keeps the caterpillar alive (and therefore fresh) as long as possible. A classic example of imperfection is what is called the recurrent laryngeal nerve which takes a bizarre route from the brain to the larynx in mammals and humans. Another example is the odd detour taken by the vas deferens - the pipe that carries sperm from the testis to the penis - in male humans. A third example is found in the sinuses of humans which has its drainage hole in the top rather than the bottom, a consequence of our shift from being quadruped to biped. Yet another example occurs in the eye - often represented by creationists as a marvel of design - where the retina is back to front, a defect that has to be corrected by the brain. In fact, the human body abounds with imperfections which can only be explained by the long process of gradual evolution and modification. One more piece of evidence against any notion of design: the genetic code as formed by DNA has an enormous amount (the majority) of redundant DNA. Why is it there? There are currently two possible explanations. The first view is that it must have coded for proteins no longer used by the descendant of the entity that did have use for that protein. If this is the case, it is not a good design. All these redundant genes (in every cell) take energy to create. What a waste. Hardly intelligent. The other view scientists are considering is that this redundant DNA may have something to do with the structural integrity of the DNA helix. But again it is not an elegant design for a structural solution and was probably the result of the DNA's long evolution to the stable structure it eventually formed utilising the redundant DNA for structural purposes. Proteins form complex structures using ionic bonds (electrical repulsion and attraction). So nature can be beautifully simple and unnecessarily complex - but that is evolution not intelligent design. Over and above the routine imperfections to be found in the natural world, the absence of design (at least by a rational and beneficient God) is evident from the vast wastefulness and immense cruelty of nature. Most animals die early, without even having the opportunity to create offspring, and they frequently die cruelly, eaten alive or torn apart by another animal, or die slowly, wasted by disease or starvation. Not a sensible or kind design or indeed any design. Argument 9: Evolution is a falsifiable theory Like any good scientific theory or law, evolution is falsifiable by contradictory evidence. There has been no such contradictory evidence. If one fossil was found in strata representing a period older or younger than one would expect to find it, then the theory would be massively challenged. This has never happened. RESPONSES TO NINE ARGUMENTS AGAINST EVOLUTION Counter argument 1: There is a missing link in the tree of life There is no missing link. Since evolution is continuous and its speed varies enormously, in a strict sense all species are in transition and it is often difficult to identify categorically when a transition occurs from one species to another. However, since Darwin first enunciated his thesis, palaeontologists have discovered many intermediate forms between different groups of animals: between fish and amphibians, between amphibians and reptiles, between reptiles and mammals, and so on. The fossil Archaeopteryx is one of the most famous, discovered in 1861, a mere two years after the first publication of ""On The Origin Of Species"". It had feathers like a bird, but teeth, claws and a bony tail like a dinaosaur. Ambulocetus, discovered in 1992, is known as the walking whale. It could walk on four legs on land and in water and heard by picking up vibrations through its jawbone like modern whales. Tiktaalik, discovered in 2004, is the link between fish and amphibian. It looked like a primative fish crossed with early four-legged animals and had lungs and gills plus fins that could support much of its weight [for more information click here]. Similarly Homo ergaster/erectus is the link between Homo habilis two million years ago and Homo sapiens today. Of course, from the perspective of a strict creationist who is determined to oppose and misunderstand evolution, each new intermediate form simply creates an extra missing link. The point is that the tree of life is not a series of distinct links but a very gradual morphing from one form to another. Counter argument 2: There are no fossils for intermediate animals such as a fronkey Of course not, because monkeys are not descended from frogs. Equally humans are not descended from chimpanzees. No modern species is descended from any other modern species. Instead evolution postulates that monkeys and frogs share a common ancestor in the same way that chimpanzees and humans share a common ancestor. Indeed, if one goes back far enough in the tree of life, then every species shares an ancestor with every other one. going all the way back to the original cells that constituted the first forms of life on Earth. Counter argument 3: There are gaps in the fossil record Of course, there are. This is not surprising. It is the inevitable result of chance fossilisations, chance discoveries, and immigration events. The major reason for gaps is ""stratigraphic discontinuities"" which means that fossil-bearing strata are not at all continuous. There are often large time breaks from one stratum to the next and there are even some times for which no fossil strata have been found."
http://www.rogerdarlington.me.uk/evolution.html,1,"What is surprising and satisfying is how comprehensive is the fossil record. Scientists worldwide have unearthed some 200 million large fossils and billions of small fossils. The biggest gap and the one most often quoted by creationists is the one that preceded the so-called Cambrian Explosion which saw the emergence of most of the main animal divisions. The period concerned was about 20 million years which seems large but occurred half a billion years ago. The explanation for the fossil gap here is probably that, before the Cambrian Explosion, most animals were soft-bodied and rather small and therefore not suitable material for fossils. Counter argument 4: We do not have an explanation for the start of evolution It is true that we have no evidence about what actually started the long process of evolution, although there are a variety of hypotheses for what is known technically as abiogenesis, most notably the iron-sulphur world theory (metabolism without genetics) and the RNA world hypothesis (RNA life-forms). [For more information click here] If the start of evolution was a simple matter, presumably there would be many occasions of life around the universe â€“ and indeed there might be (although we have no evidence for life anywhere else). The essential point is that the absence of an explanation for the origin of evolution in no way invalidates the process of evolution. It simply means that we do not yet fully understand evolution and more thinking and discovery is required. If in the meanwhile, you wish to believe that it was God who started evolution, there is no evidence either way for such a proposition, although it is of course inconsistent with a literal interpretation of the Bible and the Koran. Counter argument 5: Evolution could not create something as complex as the eye In fact, it can and it has. Creationists believe that the eye could not 'simply' evolve because there is no use for intermediate stages. Surely, for instance, a retina is useless without a lens? In reality, a a retina is not useless without a lens and many types of invertebrate animals have simple eyes with no lens for the reason that such animals do not need to see clearly. Different groups of animals display a whole series of intermediates between simple light-sensitive receptors and variable types of complex devices that produce images of the world. Indeed some creatures once had evolved eyes only for their descendants to go underground to search for food, shelter and security and then no longer need vision so, while they have kept their eyes, they are in fact are blind. Evolution can go back and forward - as further evidenced by mammals going back to the sea (this is why whales and dolphins do not breath through gills because they are descendants of land mammals and not marine life). Counter argument 6: If evolution is a continuous process, why are we not still evolving? We are â€“ natural selection never stops and humans are still evolving. It is just that the slowness of the process compared to our lives makes it hard to notice. But, for instance, our diet differs from our ancestors and our teeth now do not need to be so strong, but any dental problems can now be addressed by dental care which somewhat 'interferes' with unconstrained evolution. Counter argument 7: Evolution is contrary to the Second Law of Thermodynamics At first, this might sound like a sophisticated, even a killer, argument - but only if you know nothing about the law or misunderstand it. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that, in a closed system, entropy - that is, the state of disorder - increases. It is therefore suggested by opponents of evolution that evolution cannot be true because it involves life moving from the simple to the complex which is the opposite of entropy. In fact, quite simply evolution does not take place in a closed system because the Earth is constantly replenished by energy from the sun. So there is no contradiction. Counter argument 8: Evolution is only a theory There are two dictionary definitions of the word 'theory': one is a hypothesis proposed as an explanation and the other is a hypothesis that has been confirmed by evidence. Evolution is a theory in the second sense. It is massively supported by evidence which essentially makes it as strong a scientific law as any other. Like any law, it can be disproved by a single piece of evidence which is in contradiction to the law but, since the formulation of the 'theory' by Charles Darwin a century and a half ago, no such evidence has been adduced. Counter argument 9: We should teach the debate This argument implies that evolution and creationism are similarly valid scientific explanations for the origins of human life that should be offered for equal consideration. In scientific terms, there is no debate. There is massive scientific evidence for evolution and essentially there is no scientific evidence for creationism. Some people believe that the Holocaust never happened, but the evidence for the Holocaust is so compelling that no American or British school would 'teach the debate'. CONCLUSION The powerful arguments for evolution and the compelling evidence supporting them make this one of the strongest theories in all of science. All the counter-arguments are really weak and have no real force unless one prefers to rest on faith rather than evidence. In all the circumstances, it is remarkable how many people - perhaps most especially in the United States - adamantly stick to the explanation offered by creationism and reject (often with some anger) the notion of evolution. But then many people believe many weird things and elsewhere I have examined why this is the case [for an explanation click here]."
https://ncse.com/cej/3/3/six-flood-arguments-creationists-cant-answer,1,"Some years ago, NASA released the first deep-space photographs of the beautiful cloud-swirled blue-green agate we call earth. A reporter showed one of them to the late Samuel Shenton, then president of International Flat Earth Research Society. Shenton studied it for a moment and said, ""It's easy to see how a photograph like that could fool the untrained eye."" Well-trained eyes (and minds) are characteristic of pseudoscientists. Shenton rejected the spherical earth as conflicting with a literal interpretation of the Bible, and he trained his eyes and his mind to reject evidence that contradicted his view. Scientific creationists must similarly train their minds to reject the overwhelming evidence from geology, biology, physics, and astronomy which contradicts their interpretation of the Bible. In a public forum, the best way to demonstrate that creationism is pseudoscience is to show just how well-trained creationist minds are. Pseudoscience differs from science in several fundamental ways but most notably in its attitude toward hypothesis testing. In science, hypotheses are ideas proposed to explain the facts, and they're not considered much good unless they can survive rigorous tests. In pseudoscience, hypotheses are erected as defenses against the facts. Pseudoscientists frequently offer hypotheses flatly contradicted by well-known facts which can be ignored only by well-trained minds. Therefore, to demonstrate that creationists are pseudoscientists, one need only carry some creationist hypotheses about Noah's flood to their logical conclusions. The following six arguments will do just that, giving a sampling of the major difficulties in creationist ""flood geology."" Fossils and Animals Scientific creationists interpret the fossils found in the earth's rocks as the remains of animals that perished in the Noachian Deluge. - page 13 - Ironically, they often cite the sheer number of fossils in ""fossil graveyards"" as evidence for the Flood. In particular, creationists seem enamored by the Karroo Formation in Africa, which is estimated to contain the remains of 800 billion vertebrate animals (see Whitcomb and Morris, p. 160; Gish, p. 61). As pseudoscientists, creationists dare not test this major hypothesis that all of the fossilized animals died in the Flood. Robert E. Sloan, a paleontologist at the University of Minnesota, has studied the Karroo Formation. He asserts that the animals fossilized there range from the size of a small lizard to the size of a cow, with the average animal perhaps the size of a fox. A minute's work with a calculator shows that, if the 800 billion animals in the Karroo Formation could be resurrected, there would be twenty-one of them for every acre of land on earth. Suppose we assume (conservatively, I think) that the Karroo Formation contains 1 percent of the vertebrate fossils on earth. Then when the Flood began, there must have been at least 2,100 living animals per acre, ranging from tiny shrews to immense dinosaurs. To a noncreationist mind, that seems a bit crowded. I sprang this argument on Duane Gish during a joint appearance on WHO radio in Des Moines, Iowa, on October 21, 1980. Dr. Gish did the only thing he could: he stonewalled by challenging my figures, in essence calling me a liar. I didn't have a calculator with me, but I duplicated the calculation with pencil and paper and hit him with it again. His reply was that creationists can't answer everything. He further stated that it has been estimated that there are 100 billion billion herring in the sea and asked how I account for that. I tried this number on a calculator and discovered that it amounts to about 27,000 herring per square foot of ocean surface. I concluded (a) that all of the herring are red and (b) that they were created ex nihilo by Duane Gish on the evening of October 21, 1980."
https://ncse.com/cej/3/3/six-flood-arguments-creationists-cant-answer,1,"Marine Fossils The continents are, on an average, covered with sedimentary rock to a depth of about one mile. Some of the rock (chalk, for instance) is essentially 100 percent fossils and many limestones also contain high percentages of marine fossils. On the other hand, some rock is barren. Suppose that, on an average, marine fossils comprise 0.1 percent of the volume of the rock. If all of the fossilized animals could be resurrected, they would cover the entire planet to a depth of at least 1.5 feet. What did they eat? Creationists can't appeal to the tropical paradise they imagine existed below the pre-Flood canopy, because the laws of thermodynamics prohibit the earth from supporting that much animal biomass. The first law says that energy can't be created, so the animals would have to get their energy from the sun. The second law limits the efficiency with which solar energy can be converted into food. The amount of solar energy available is not nearly sufficient. - page 14 - Varves The famous Green River Formation (including shale and limestone) covers tens of thousands of square miles. In at least one place, it contains about twenty million varves, each varve consisting of a thin layer of fine light sediment and an even thinner layer of finer dark sediment. According to the conventional geologic interpretation, the layers are sediments laid down in a complex of ancient freshwater lakes. The coarser light sediments were laid down during the summer, when streams poured run-off water into the lake. The fine dark sediments were laid down in the winter when there was less run-off. (This process can be observed in modern freshwater lakes.) If this interpretation is correct, the varves of the Green River Formation must have formed over a period of about twenty million years. Creationists insist that the earth is no more than 10,000 years old and that the geologic strata were laid down by the Flood. Whitcomb and Morris therefore attempt to attribute the Green River varves to ""a complex of shallow turbidity currents ..."" (p. 427). Turbidity currentsâ€”flows of mud-laden waterâ€”generally occur in the ocean, resulting from underwater landslides. If the Green River shales were laid down during the Flood, there must have been forty million turbidity currents, alternately light and dark, over about three hundred days. A simple calculation (which creationists have avoided for twenty years) shows that the layers must have formed at the rate of about three layers every two seconds. A sequence of forty million turbidity currents covering tens of thousands of square miles every two-thirds of a second seems a bit unlikely. Henry Morris apparently has no answer to this. Biologist Kenneth Miller of Brown University dropped this bombshell on Morris during a debate in Tampa, Florida, on September 19, 1981, and Morris didn't attempt a reply. Fred Edwords used essentially the same argument against Duane Gish in a debate on February 2, 1982, at the University of Guelph, Ontario. In rebuttal, Gish claimed that some of the fossilized fishes project through several layers of sediment and that therefore the layers can't be semiannual. As usual, Gish's argument ignores the main issue, which is the alleged formation of millions of distinct layers of sediment in less than a year. Furthermore, Gish's argument is false, according to American Museum of Natural History paleontologist R. Lance Grande, an authority on the Green River Formation. Grande says that, while bones or fins of an individual fish may cut several layers, in general each fish is blanketed by a single layer of sediment. The few exceptions are explainable when one observes lakes where varves are forming today. It sometimes happens that a dead fish is too large to be covered by one semiannual sedimentation, and so its bones or fins end up protruding through newer layers that are later observed to form. When an object or animal is too large, this must happen, and therefore such a protrusion cannot be used as evidence against a great age for the Green River Formation."
https://ncse.com/cej/3/3/six-flood-arguments-creationists-cant-answer,1,"- page 15 - Disease Germs Humankind is the only known ""reservoir"" for numerous communicable diseases. That is, the germs or viruses which cause these diseases can survive only in living human bodies or well-equipped laboratories. Well-known examples include measles, pneumococcal pneumonia, leprosy, typhus, typhoid fever, small pox, poliomyelitis, syphilis, and gonorrhea. The scientific creationists insist on a completed creation, in which the creator worked but six days and has been resting ever since. Thus, between them, Adam and Eve had to have been created with every disease and had to have passed them all to their children. Later, somebody must have carried them onto Noah's ark. Note that the argument covers every disease germ or virus which can survive only in a specific host. But even if the ark was a floating pesthouse, few of these diseases could have survived. In most cases, only two animals of each ""kind"" are supposed to have been on the ark. Suppose the male of such a pair came down with such a disease shortly after the ark embarked. He recovered but passed the disease to his mate. She recovered, too, but had no other animal to pass the disease to, for the male was now immune. Every disease for which this cycle lasts less than a year should therefore have become extinct. Furthermore, fatal diseases would have caused both the host animals and the diseases to disappear. Creationists cannot pin the blame for germs on Satan. If they do, the immediate question is: How do we know Satan didn't create the rest of the universe? That has frequently been proposed, and, if Satan can create one thing, he can create another. If a creationist tries to claim that germs are mutations of otherwise benign organisms (degenerate forms, of course), then he or she is arguing for evolution. Such hypothetical mutations could only be considered favorable, since only the mutated forms survived. Fossil Sequence At all costs, creationists avoid discussing how fossils came to be stratified as they are. Out of the thousands of pages that Henry Morris has written on creationism, only a dozen or so are devoted to this critical subject, and he achieves that page count only by recycling three simple apologetics in several books. The mechanisms he offers might be called victim habitat, victim mobility, and hydraulic sorting. In practice, the victim habitat and mobility apologetics are generally combined. Creationists argue that the Flood would first engulf marine animals, then slow lowland creatures such as reptiles, while wily and speedy humans escaped to the hilltops. To a creationist, this adequately explains the order in which fossils occur in the geologic column. A scientist might test the mobility hypothesis by examining how well it explains the fact that flowering plants don't occur in the fossil record until early in the Cretaceous era. - page 16 - A scenario with magnolias (a primitive plant) heading for the hills, only to be overwhelmed along with early mammals, is unconvincing. And when marine fossils are found in many places above those of land animals and plants, the victim habitat apologetic loses all credibility, too."
https://ncse.com/cej/3/3/six-flood-arguments-creationists-cant-answer,1,"If explanations based on victim habitat and mobility are absurd, the hydraulic sorting apologetic is flatly contradicted by the fossil record. An object's hydrodynamic drag is directly proportional to its cross-sectional area and its drag coefficient. Therefore, when objects with the same density and the same drag coefficient move through a fluid, they are sorted according to size. (Mining engineers utilize this phenomena in some ore separation processes.) This means that all small trilobites should be found higher in the fossil record than large ones. Since this is not what we find, the hydraulic sorting argument is immediately falsified. Indeed, one wonders how Henry Morris could ever have offered it, given his background as a hydraulic engineer. Overturned Strata Ever since the geological arguments of George McCready Price became a mainstay of creationism in the 1920s and 1930s, many creationists have tried to point out places in the earth where fossils appear in the opposite order for evolution. They claim that reversals in the order prove that the geologic column is fiction. They then challenge scientists to come up with an explanation. Actually, scientists have a good explanation for this reversal in the fossil order. They point to obvious signs of folding in the strata, which reveal how the ancient sediments have been flipped over. In such places, it should be expected that the geologic column would read backwards. When it is not so obvious that this has occurred, there is another way to tell. If rock strata containing trilobites are overturned, the trilobites that are usually found belly down in the rock will now be found belly up. Other things which show geologists and paleontologists which way is up include worm and brachiopod burrows, footprints, fossilized mud cracks, raindrop craters, graded bedding, and similar evidences. It is really creationists who have no explanation for such strata. Could the flood suddenly reverse the laws of gravity and lay up sediments and fossils instead of laying them down? Upside-down sediments are clearly a problem for the creation model. This isn't surprising, however, given that right-side-up sediments seem to be a problem for it, too. - page 17 - Each of the six preceding arguments subjects a well-known creationist hypothesis to an elementary and obvious test. In each case, the hypothesis fails miserably. In each case, the failure is obvious to anyone not protected from reality by a special kind of blindness. Studying science doesn't make one a scientist any more than studying ethics makes one honest. The studies must be applied. Forming and testing hypotheses is the foundation of science, and those who refuse to test their hypotheses cannot be called scientistsâ€”no matter what their credentials. Most persons who call themselves creationists have no scientific training and they cannot be expected to know and apply the scientific method. But the professional creationists who flog the public with their doctorates (earned, honorary, or bogus) have no excuse. Because they fail to submit their hypotheses to the most elementary tests, they fully deserve the appellation of pseudoscientist."
https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/2016/09/12/borrowed-signals-a-discussion-of-the-guilty-dog-look/,1,"""Over the last couple months, I have received several questions by email and at my book talks in response to my discussion of the “guilty dog look” in my recent book. For that reason, I’d like to expand my discussion a little bit, because it’s a very interesting phenomenon that goes far beyond the dog-human relationship. In the book, I discuss how the dog I had as a child would do the guilty look whenever she had an accident in the house, and how my current dog will do it if he accidentally nips me while chewing his rubber bone. (Something that happens more often than you’d think because for some reason he likes me to hold the bone while he chews it – it’s kind of obnoxious, I know.) The guilty look that dogs give is also called the “apology bow” and has been studied extensively in wolves by animal behaviorists including Marc Bekoff. While it may seem like a trivial action, it is actually involved in multiple fairly sophisticated social behaviors. As so often happens when studying behavior, or anything else in biology for that matter, a close look reveals far more complexity than initially expected. """
https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/2016/09/12/borrowed-signals-a-discussion-of-the-guilty-dog-look/,1,"In wolves, juveniles first begin to display the apology bow as they begin their social integration. Besides nursing, the first social interactions that wolves engage in is play, usually rough-and-tumble wrestling. You’ve probably seen dogs wrestle and they have inherited this play behavior from their wolf ancestors.
Wrestling and other forms of physical play are  very important for wolves for several reasons, one of which is to help learn the social rules of being a properly behaved wolf. To the untrained observer, it may look like fighting, but it isn’t and the rules help make sure of that. Rough playing is fine, but strong biting is forbidden and so is forcing a fight with a much smaller dog. There are other rules, too.
A dog that bites too hard is punished by temporary shunning. They are removed from the social unit and ignored for a time. In order to be reintroduced, the offending wolf must approach with an apology bow and be re-admitted into the group.
Dogs have inherited this behavior and they will use it after any kind of infraction that results in being punished. As social animals, they crave harmonious integration in the  group and neglect or isolation is "

Sharp observers of animal behavior may remark that the “guilty look” has nothing to do with apology or guilt, but rather this is the submissive posture. That is absolutely correct. The actions associated with the apology bow mimic the action shown when a wolf indicates submission to a more dominant, higher-ranking wolf. The head hangs low, panting or smiling stops, eye-contact is avoided, and they literally put their tail between their legs. So which is it – is the wolf (or dog) indicating apology or submission?
Well, both. This action is a “borrowed signal” because it can mean different things in different contexts. In a sense, an apology is indeed an expression of submission. “I was right; you were wrong.” Nothing could be more submissive than that. In fact, dominant dogs and wolves rarely issue apologies (just like dominant humans!) and lower-ranking ones must apologize for even the slightest infraction.
Borrowed signals are found in other contexts as well. In primates, common signals for apologies and dispute resolution are less about submission and more about affiliation. In other words, apologies look "
https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/2016/09/12/borrowed-signals-a-discussion-of-the-guilty-dog-look/,1,"like greetings, and this holds even in humans.
In the US, the most common action when two adults meet is the hand-shake. This is a friendly action, indicating a desire for affiliation, as opposed to rivalry. As a consequence, we pull this behavior out whenever we make up after a fight also. If two friends get into an argument and then wish to bury the hatchet and move on, they often seal the reconciliation with a handshake.
In Europe, the two-cheek kiss can substitute for the handshake in both settings, and in Asia, a stiff bow performs mostly the same functions. The key here is that signals of greeting are recycled during reconciliation because the ultimate message is the same: affiliation. The handshake/kiss/hug/bow says the same thing in both uses: I wish to be friends (or friends again) with you.
Facial expressions and body language are rich forms of communication among animals and a complex array of signals can be conveyed with just a few gestures. The key is context. Just like humans rarely misinterpret a smile from a snarl, animals surely understand the subtleties of their own body language.

https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/2016/04/18/in-defense-of-lamarck-historical-philosophical-and-biological-vindication-of-evolutions-first-big-idea/,0,"Despite being one of the most influential of the early modern biologists and having crucially paved the way for Darwin, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck has mostly gone down in history for being wrong. His theory of “use and disuse” as a mechanism for evolution was roundly rejected and is often presented in introductory biology textbooks as totally misguided and even silly.
Historian Jessica Riskin, of Stanford University, has written a new book entitled, “The Restless Clock: A History of the Centuries-Long Argument over What Makes Living Things Tick.” In this book, she urges a fresh look at the bold and imaginative ideas of Lamarck and how they inspired the naturalists that followed him.
More provocatively, Professor Riskin shines the same harsh light of historical hindsight that has tormented Lamarck onto Darwin, Huxley, and even the neo-Darwinians of the modern era. Her surprising conclusion is that the modern packaging of evolutionary theory has not fully loosed itself from the theological compromises brokered by the Victorians.
Professor Riskin advances the controversial and intriguing claim that our neo-darwinian understanding of evolution actually robs living things of their agency in devising their own solutions to the challenges of surviving and thriving in a planet teeming with competitors, and surrenders it to the “prime mover,” now thought of as random mutation but originally imagined to be a divine clock-maker.
This may seem like philosophical mumbo-jumbo to scientists steeped in the new evolutionary synthesis, but there is one point that cannot be ignored: we now know that certain biochemically coded information can indeed be passed from one generation to the next beyond the fixed sequence of DNA. Experiences as diverse as stress, diet, injury, and intoxication can leave epigenetic and/or biochemical marks on our gamete cells (sperm and eggs) which can then be passed on to the resulting zygote. (More on that below.)
In sum, we now know of concrete mechanisms by which current conditions can affect the way our genes are inherited. It’s not quite Lamarck’s giraffe passing on a long neck for having stretched her own, but it’s also not the rigid prevailing dogma that the genetic material we pass on to our progeny was strictly fixed before we were even born.
Below, Professor Riskin summarizes her research into how the big ideas of evolutionary theory took shape and reveals the surprising echoes of an early form of theological evolution that can still be heard today. For a more thorough exploration, I recommend her book, The Restless Clock.
Too often, we scientist and science educators overlook how the ideas we hold so dear took shape.  -NHL
<<<<<
You’ve heard of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, the misguided Frenchman who said that when a giraffe sticks out its neck to reach high leaves on a tree, it has longer-necked babies, the Lamarck whose outlandish theory awaited sober refutation by Darwin. But did you know that Lamarck was the first to suggest a separate science of living things and then coined the term “biology?” He was also the  first to develop a systematic theory of what we now call evolution. Darwin himself, as well as every major Darwinist until the end of the nineteenth century, was really a Lamarckian.
They were Lamarckians in the sense that they all espoused core principles of Lamarck’s theory of the development of species. In particular, they believed that living forms changed over time in law-like ways, an idea that Lamarck was the first to develop, and that the causes of these changes included the habits, behaviors and willful actions of individual organisms.
Around the turn of the twentieth century, “Lamarckism” became the antithesis, not only of Darwinism, but of all legitimate science. Lamarck was suddenly not just wrong, but absurd, beyond the pale, even dangerous. What happened?
The question would be intriguing even were it not for the fact that a century later, in the 1980’s and ‘90’s, Lamarckism began to move quietly back into the scientific fold. Still, the anti-Lamarckian interpretation of evolution has remained powerful. The philosopher of biology Daniel Dennett has observed that a demonstration of Lamarckian inheritance would be “fatal to Darwinism,” but is “safely discredited,” while the biologist and writer Richard Dawkins has described what he calls a “Lamarckian scare,” confessing, “to be painfully honest,” a return to Lamarckian evolution would “devastate my world view.”
These are extreme terms – “painful,” “scary,” “fatal,” “devastating.” Dennett and Dawkins, and other neo-Darwinists, have clearly seen Lamarckism as a threat, not just to a particular scientific idea or theory, but to an entire worldview, to modern science, to reason itself. Why? I believe this feeling of menace has evolved from an older one, in which it was not science or reason that was being threatened, but rather a kind of limited partnership arrangement between science and theology.
To understand this unspoken arrangement between science and theology, you must first consider that the founding model of modern science, established during the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth "
https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/2016/04/18/in-defense-of-lamarck-historical-philosophical-and-biological-vindication-of-evolutions-first-big-idea/,0,"century, assumed and indeed relied upon the existence of a supernatural God. The founders of modern science, including people such as René Descartes, Isaac Newton and Robert Boyle, described the world as a machine, like a great clock, whose parts were made of inert matter, moving only when set in motion by some external (divine) force.
These thinkers insisted that one could not explain the movements of the great clock of nature by ascribing desires or tendencies or willful actions to its parts. That was against the rules. They banished any form of agency – purposeful or willful action – from nature’s machinery and from natural science. In so doing, they gave a monopoly on agency to an external god, leaving behind a fundamentally passive natural world. Henceforth, science would describe the passive machinery of nature, while questions of meaning, purpose and agency would be the province of theology.
In other words, the founding model of nature in modern science, a passive world- machine, arose hand-in-hand with a core tradition in modern theology, the argument from design, which finds evidence of the existence of a rational God in the rational design of nature. Of course, forces and tendencies (gravitational, electrical, magnetic, fluid…) permeated modern physics. The question of whether these forces originated inside or outside the world-machine provoked some debate, but those who argued for an intrinsically active world-machine were not able to hold sway over those, notably Newton and his followers, who argued that natural forces originated outside nature’s machinery in the will of God. The evacuation of purposeful action from a passive world- machine remained entrenched in science.
Lamarck’s theory threatened all this. Instead of appealing to an external source for the agency involved in the creation and transformation of living forms, Lamarck proposed to naturalize that agency, to consider it a natural force like the forces of contemporary experimental physics such as gravity, electricity or magnetism, and to insist that all of these forces originated within the world-machine. For one thing, Lamarck hypothesized a rudimentary, upward-striving pouvoir de la vie that drove all organisms to complexify and elaborate themselves over time.
In addition to this primitive life force, another kind of agency acted in animals as well, according to Lamarck, namely their “habits,” their “ways of life” and acts of will. “When the will determines an animal to perform a given action,” he wrote, “the organs that must execute this action are immediately provoked” to carry it out. Many repetitions of these “acts of organization” would then “fortify, extend, develop and even create the necessary organs.”
Both sorts of Lamarckian living agency, the rudimentary, primitive force of life and the higher force of will, were internal to the works, constitutive of the machinery from within. Lamarck argued that this must be the case, because if each creature instead owed its organization to a force outside itself, then instead of being animate machines, animals would be “totally passive machines.” They would never have had “sensibility or the intimate sentiment of existence that follows from it,” nor the power to act, nor ideas, nor thought, nor intelligence. They would not, in short, have been alive.
The notion that living beings produced themselves by their own agency was controversial. Lamarck’s fellow naturalist and critic, the devout Lutheran zoologist Georges Cuvier, famously rejected it. It was Cuvier who wrote poor Lamarck’s eulogy: rarely can a eulogy have offered fainter praise. Cuvier observed that no one had found Lamarck’s theory worth attacking, since it rested upon the “arbitrary” assumption “that desires [and] efforts, can engender organs,” an idea that might “amuse the imagination of a poet” but could never persuade a true anatomist. The theological implications of Lamarck’s view that living beings created and continually re-made themselves cannot have pleased the pious Cuvier.
Several decades later, Lamarck (or anyway his theory) encountered an even more effective attack at the hands of the German biologist August Weismann, whose interpretation of Darwinian evolution became the standard one in the 20th century (Dawkins and Dennett both describe themselves as neo-Weismannists). The “Darwinism” of Weismann’s redefinition eliminated all Lamarckian inner agencies, which had figured in Darwin’s original theory. Weismann located evolutionary agency decisively outside the organism, insisting that organisms had no role in shaping their evolutionary destiny: no kind of experience or behavior on the part of an individual organism could change the machinery of inheritance.
An unbreachable barrier separated somatic (body) cells from germ (reproductive) cells according to Weismann. He insisted that no changes taking place in the somatic cells could ever be transmitted to the germ cells. This enormously influential idea, eliminating the possibility of “inheritance of acquired characteristics,” became known as the Weismann barrier.
An earlobe mutilation that was not transmitted to the next generation from August Weismann’s, “Supposed Transmission of Mutilations” (1888). 
Weismann also had some collateral victims, namely several generations of mice. Although he was not a farmer’s wife, and most likely did not use a carving knife, he did chop the tails off these hapless mice in "
https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/2016/04/18/in-defense-of-lamarck-historical-philosophical-and-biological-vindication-of-evolutions-first-big-idea/,0,"order to show that their offspring had perfectly healthy, normal-length tails. Weismann presented this as a definitive refutation of Lamarckism, although he himself also quietly acknowledged that it had no real bearing on Lamarck’s theory, since having one’s tail chopped off is not a behavior, habit, or act of will (nor, for that matter, did the experiment disprove Lamarck’s intrinsic upward-tending force of life). But Weismann said his mice would defeat the popular version of belief in inheritance of acquired characteristics.
This was a spoof rather than a refutation, but what it lacked in relevance, it made up in clarity, and it still appears in textbooks as the final disproof of Lamarckian inheritance.
The “Weismann barrier” separating somatic cells from germ cells was in effect a barrier between individual agency and evolutionary transformation. It remained such – a denial of evolutionary agency to organisms – as it became a core principle of neo- Darwinism, when Francis Crick restated it as the “Central Dogma” of molecular biology.
Crick’s “Central Dogma” states that there is no reverse translation from protein to RNA to DNA – the transcription only happens in one direction, from DNA to RNA to protein – which is essentially a translation of the Weismann barrier into the language of genetics. So Weismann’s barrier between individual agency and evolutionary transformation became an axiom of genetics.
In order to truly understand their core axioms, scientists should understanding something about their histories. Never is this more crucial than with the origins of Weismann’s barrier: Weismann was working around the turn of the 20th century within the emerging German model of a research university, in which the science and theology faculties struck a kind of bargain. The science faculties restricted themselves to demonstrations, in ever more specialized detail, of the mechanical complexity of natural forms, while leaving the questions of meaning, will, and agency to the theology faculties.
It was an institutional application of the argument from design, which had banished agency to the province of a supernatural god, leaving behind a mechanical world that was infinitely intricate but essentially passive.
Weismann subscribed to the established scientific axiom that agency was supernatural, operating only outside of nature’s machinery. He described purposefulness, the source of meaning and direction, as lying beyond the mechanism of the universe, in the province of what he called a “spiritual First Cause” or a “teleological Universal Cause” (with capital letters to suggest divinity).
His mechanist approach to biology was overtly teleological, as he himself stressed: “Without teleology, there would be no mechanism” he wrote, and also “without mechanism there would be no teleology.” He emphasized that his conception of the universe was therefore anti-materialist, because it assumed a purposeful divinity. Strange that this is the same Weismann that Dawkins and Dennet so revere.
The ideas of Weismannism were brought to the United States in the middle decades of the 20th century by another product of the German research university, Ernst Mayr. Mayr studied biology at the University of Berlin in the mid-1920’s, receiving his PhD in 1926. His adviser was the ornithologist Erwin Stresemann, who greatly admired Weismann for having vanquished Lamarkcism. Stresemann was a firm subscriber to the passive- mechanical view of living beings. Stresemann wrote, for example, “an animal does not act for itself, but under a higher commission: animal non agit, sed agitur [an animal does not act, but is acted upon],” and he endorsed the view that “[t]he animal does not think, does not reflect, does not establish aims for itself, and if it nevertheless behaves purposively, then someone must have thought for it.”
Notice in both of those expressions how the passive mechanism of the animal implies a higher power, an external Someone.
When Mayr went to New York in 1931, he brought his training and influences with him. By then, the United States had been importing the German model of the research university, particularly in biology, for more than half a century, since the founding of Johns Hopkins in 1876 on the template of the University of Berlin. American biology was a well-prepared soil into which to plant Weismann’s ideas and the model of science they represented.
Now, I don’t mean to ascribe theological motivations to Mayr himself, who reminisced that he had first become interested as a boy in reading the work of naturalists such as Ernst Haeckel “to have ammunition in arguments about the Bible and religion,” and certainly not to Dennett or Dawkins, atheism’s leading missionaries, but rather to point out the hidden and surprising historical origins of the dogma they have all defended with such force and power. In defending it, they are heirs, however ironically, to a theological tradition, the argument from design.
Dawkins takes the Weismann barrier, recast as the Central Dogma, to be the all- important firewall between science and religion, keeping scientific explanation free of teleological appeals to purpose or agency. But a wall has two sides and in historical terms this one was first built to serve the reciprocal "

>>>>>>>>>>>>
Viewing Lamarck as the founder of our modern view that life can create and shape its own reality begins the rehabilitation of his reputation. However, I think that recent discoveries in molecular biology vindicate him as well.
In the simplest example, it is clear that the physiological state of the womb, and therefore of the woman, have an impact on how genes are expressed in an embryo or even a fully-formed fetus. (I say “woman” and not “mother” because the most convincing research has been done in surrogate pregnancies.) There are a variety of ways in which this happens, but it most often occurs via a phenomenon called epigenetics.
Epigenetics refers to how covalent modification of DNA (or more often, the histone proteins closely associated with DNA) affects how that DNA is expressed. A couple decades ago, biologists assumed that all of the differences and diversity among human beings were captured in subtle differences in our genome sequences, the As and Cs and Gs and Ts. We now know that genetic control of our phenotype (how our bodies look, act, and function) is much deeper than that. The exact same DNA sequence can be expressed very differently in two different cells based on how that DNA is “marked up” by epigenetics.
We should have seen this coming. Scientists have long known that the cells of our liver to do things very differently than the cells of our bones, for example, despite having the exact same genome sequence. Skin cells and neurons couldn’t behave more differently, couldn’t look more distinct, and yet the only differences in their genes are found in the epigenetic modifications.
How does this support Lamarck? For one thing, it demolishes all notions of the Weismann barrier. Events in our lives do effect how the genes in our gametes function when they give rise to our offspring. Identical twins begin their lives with the same genome sequence but differences in gene expression accumulate over time such that everyone who knows them well can easily note their many physical and psychological differences. Not surprisingly, epigenetic differences can be found in their gametes as well.
The most dramatic example of Lamarckian inheritance has recently been reported in cases of surrogate pregnancy. Scientists working at a fertility clinic in Spain have discovered a mechanism by which the genetics of  gestational surrogates is passed on to developing fetuses. The vehicle for this genetic transmission is something called micro-RNA, usually abbreviated miRNA, or simply, miR. Doctors found that micro-RNA molecules encoded by the surrogate mother’s genome were expressed and secreted by her endometrium into the uterine fluid and taken up by the developing embryo. These miRNA molecules, which have variations among individuals (which is how the scientists could detect this phenomenon) are capable of changing how genes are expressed and initiating the placement of specific epigenetic marks on DNA that then have further effects on gene expression.
Put simply, the genes of the surrogate mother appear to have affects on the genes of the offspring. While the discovery focused on the possibility of genetic influence from a “non-genetic mother,” the Lamarckian implication is that, in a standard pregnancy, a mother’s physiology can affect how the genes of her offspring are expressed in real-time. The phenotype of the developing child is not simply a function of her gene sequences, but is also influenced by the life history of her mother before and during the pregnancy. That’s a clear molecular manifestation of  Lamarck’s ideas.
There are other molecular examples of how phenotype is much more than simply inherited gene sequences. In the phenomenon of RNA editing, a gene sequence is actually altered at the time of expression. DNA methylation can result in dramatic and relatively permanent changes in how genes are turned on and turned off. We are well aware of how stress hormones, and all hormones and signaling factors really, can alter the biochemistry and gene expression machinery of both gametes and developing embryos. Differential splicing, where the same gene can lead to a multitude of slightly different proteins, is well known but poorly understood. All of these phenomena emphasize how gene sequences are just part of the story.
Even something as simple as egg polarity, where gene expression factors are clustered on one side of the egg, can have dramatic long-term effects on the interplay between genotype and phenotype. Not surprisingly, micro-RNAs and epigenetics influence all of these super-genetic phenomena.
The field of genetics has long known that phenotypes are built from much more than just genotypes. DNA sequences are the raw building materials, but they are not the house. It is beyond question that the environment and other physiological conditions profoundly influence how our bodies and minds spring forth from our genes. We also now know that some of that is heritable.
And that’s a positively Lamarckian truth.

http://evolutionlist.blogspot.com/2010/12/is-science-true.html,1,"In my experience, everyone bases their ""arguments on certain metaphysical suppositions, scientists and non-scientists included. As a good friend and student of E. A. Burtt, I have found his Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science to be extraordinarily useful in this regard. In fact, I have begun work on what I hope will be a companion volume: Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Biological Science, in which I will examine the assumptions that underlie the science of biology as it is practiced today.
One of the bedrock assumptions underlying both modern physics and modern biology is non-teleology: the assumption that natural processes do not include any teleological input. I personally think that this is wrong, and base my objection to this idea on Ernst Mayr's monumental book, Toward a New Philosophy of Biology, published in 1988. Mayr argued very persuasively that teleological explanations are entirely appropriate in biology insofar as they refer to the development and maintenance of living organisms. According to Mayr, both of these processes (and indeed all biological processes) are directed by programs (i.e. genomes, etc.) that pre-exist the entities and processes that they specify and regulate. In "
http://evolutionlist.blogspot.com/2010/12/is-science-true.html,1,"the jargon of the current debate, genomes and other developmental programs are ""designs"" for the assembly and operation of living organisms.
However, Mayr also argued very strongly that the origin of biological programs – that is, the various mechanisms of biological evolution – need not (and apparently do not) include any teleological component. Like all physical processes, there is no detectable ""grand design"" (much less a Grand Designer) which/Who has formulated beforehand the programs that regulate life. In other words, teleology is entirely appropriate when applied to life and the operation of living programs, but not when applied to the origin of life or the origin of living programs.
So, what does this say about the question of whose opinions to trust when considering these issues? My first criterion is skepticism: if someone claims to know the truth about anything at all (including, of course, the contents of their own mind), my immediate reaction is intense skepticism. Science (at least that version of it that has been practiced since the 17th century) isn't about truth. It's about reasonable confidence in explanatory models, all of which are grounded on a metaphysical assumption of the "
http://evolutionlist.blogspot.com/2010/12/is-science-true.html,1,"usefulness of methodological naturalism. Notice I wrote ""usefulness"", not ""truth"", because as far as I can tell the only ""truth"" that exists on either side of the evolution/ID divide is a version of Colbert's ""truthiness"". It feels like ""truth"", but isn't really. In my opinion, ""experts"" are people who keep these distinctions in mind at all times, and do not easily (if ever) use absolute statements when talking about nature.
For example, I have an immediate, knee-jerk negative reaction to the title of Jerry Coyne's book, Why Evolution is True, and indeed to much of what he writes for the general public. Consider a similar title, Why Quantum Mechanics is True, or if you prefer Why the Gas Laws are True. How would a physicist react to titles such as these? I hope (and my general experience has been) that they would object to the word ""true"", and also perhaps to the question ""why"". Physics isn't about ""truth"" and doesn't usually ask about ""why"" things happen. Physics is about ""useful"" and ""consistent"" and ""empirically testable"" models of reality, and it's about ""how"" things happen, not ""why"" they happen.
Indeed, in the natural sciences (including biology) the answer to the question ""how"" is the same as the "

They inherit a genetic and developmental program that, via interactions with their environment, produces those structures we call ""wings"". Why do birds come to have wings? Same answer. How have birds acquired these genetic and developmental programs? They evolved by natural selection and other evolutionary mechanisms. Why have birds acquired these genetic and developmental programs? Again, same answer.
Speculating as to whether the biological processes by which the programs that specify and regulate living organisms and processes are somehow externally/supernaturally directed seems to me to be metaphysical arguments, rather than scientific ones. Interesting, compelling even, but not part of science, at least as it has been practiced for a very long time.

"
http://www.rooshv.com/the-theory-of-evolution-does-not-apply-to-modern-human-beings,-1,"I know your blood is already boiling from reading the headline above and that your intellectual self-defense mechanisms have been activated to refute all ideas you are about to encounter henceforth, but make yourself a cup of tea, relax, and consider the following viewpoint that has been concealed from you during your entire life.
Since high school I have believed in the theory of evolution, a logical and elegant solution over religious explanations in describing how life originated and evolved on earth. For the next 15 years, including four years studying microbiology in university, I never once doubted the theory, and have even infused the “survive and reproduce” paradigm into the theories and ideas I have shared on my blog and in my books. This paradigm is also a domineering belief in the “red pill” platform.
In the past year a thought entered my brain that I had trouble addressing: why have I yet to reproduce? I’m nearly 36 years old, with ample resources, intellect, health, biological “strength”, and access to females, but I have not yet produced a child. It’s not that I’m ejaculating inside women but failing to impregnate them, but I’m consciously and deliberately halting insemination for reasons that Darwin and his followers have not addressed, such as bad marriage laws and wanting to be free without obligations.
I’ve had more fertile sexual partners than some kings and nobles of old, but have not reproduced once, meaning that game, in the way I have practiced and taught it, has gone squarely against evolution. In other words, remaining a virgin to this day as opposed to embarking on a multi-year world sex tour with triple-digit partners would not at all have changed the childless result I face in this very moment.
Anti-evolutionary behaviors should have been weeded out of the gene pool according to the idea of natural selection, but the more I looked around, the more I saw nothing but my own behavior, of people who were actually frightened to death about being a parent even though they were healthy and could afford to raise children. In fact, the sum of Western ideologies seem aimed to specifically halt human reproduction.
Western people are structuring their lives in deliberate ways to not reproduce at all and where their cherished hedonistic lifestyles would be greatly harmed if children entered the picture, and while it’s easy to use evolutionary theory in describing which man a woman chooses to have sex with, how can that possibly be correct if the man used condoms or the woman used birth control? Darwin’s theory refers to reproduction, not recreational sex and definitely not a prolonged period of sterile sport fucking, which has no benefit to the genes of the “athlete.” Having an explanation for why a girl on birth control went home with the “alpha male” after meeting him in the club has nothing to do with evolution or natural selection, since they both knew that no child would result and used the full force of their consciousness to prevent the creation of life. If reproduction was the purposefully blocked intent, evolution was not present during the sex event.
How could Darwin explain the prevention of reproduction by deliberate and conscious choice from fit humans beings? How could he explain that the richest peoples of the world with no lack in resources, intellect, and functioning reproductive systems were consciously going against what evolution prescribed for them?
The one aspect of evolution, specifically, that does not hold true for modern humans, especially those living in the West, is that fit humans are reproducing up to the limit of the food supply, as stated by Darwin. In fact, the more resources a person has, the less likely they will reproduce at all, which you can witness at any time in a drive through the poor and rich parts of your city. Darwin’s theory doesn’t explain why this occurs, why the “strongest” and most “fit” are having the least amount of offspring or deliberately choosing not to have any offspring at all, even though natural selection specifically states that only the strongest can pass on their genes while the weak and infirm will not.
Most animals, plants, and bacteria do reproduce up to the limit of the food supply, or at least try to maximally have as many offspring as possible, but human beings have developed a consciousness that enables them to purposefully not reproduce even if they are able, and even develop a phobia to reproduction, and this has been in effect for at least 100 years in all major Western nations that currently suffer a death rate greater than the reproductive rate.
We must therefore conclude, with logic and rationale, that evolution is so flawed at explaining modern human reproductive behavior (and not merely casual sex where reproduction was never the intent), that evolution is not an observable or correct principle for human beings living in Westernized nations. We must discard evolutionary theory as applying to all humans through the mechanism of natural selection and begin a search for a new explanation that explains our current biological behavior.
Evolution may have been the correct theory for a window of human existence, but that window has now closed and theories for post-evolutionary man, one in which there is no struggle for survival and where the strongest of the species are not reproducing, must be devised.
Even if we were to concede that we got here through the process of evolution from a primordial soup, and that our brains are the result of it, these brains are now in a modern environment which has tripwired, hijacked, or corrupted any applicable evolutionary program. We have become one with the plugged-in cosmopolitan borg, and that regardless of the process that caused us to come about, that process is no longer in effect and a new process, yet to be described or understood, is manifesting itself throughout humanity and shattering Darwin’s “survive and reproduce” model.
It’s unlikely that, after reading what I have stated so far, a Darwinist would seriously doubt his faith in evolution. His mind is already racing for the rationalizations that allow evolution to remain true for him, and it’s this race that allows evolution to frame all biological explanations through Darwin’s brain. People are so invested in a theory that tells them what the end point is (i.e. everything we do is to survive and reproduce), that many hardcore atheists are no different from religious fundamentalists in the mental gymnastics they take every day to keep their faith alive.
A book that pokes numerous holes to the evolutionary boat is Darwinian Fairytales by Australian philosopher David Stove. While not a scientist by trade, Stove provides over a dozen non-religious arguments against evolution that were not presented to us during our scientific education in school. After reading through this book carefully, I have determined that evolutionary theory is no longer useful in describing the modern day behavior of human beings. Based on my scientific background, this did take great upheaval to my belief system, but there are too many doubts to the theory, mostly based from my own observation of human behavior, that I can’t believe such a flawed model any longer.
Evolution is not applying to modern humans
From Darwinian Fairytales:
If Darwin’s theory of evolution were true, there would be in every species a constant and ruthless competition to survive: a competition in which only a few in any generation can be winners. But it is perfectly obvious that human life is not like that, however it may be with other species.
[…]
That theory is a universal generalization about all terrestrial species at any time. Hence, if the theory says something which is not true now of our species (or another), then it is not true—-finish… If Darwin’s theory of evolution is true, no species can ever escape from the process of natural selection.
If you look outside your window, you’ll see that there is no longer a vicious fight for survival, even in desperately poor nations. The sick and handicap, thanks to society’s intervention (a society created by the human animal that evolution supposedly applies to), can survive with ease, and even the mentally inferior who lives on the altruism of others can reproduce to their biological limit assuming they possess basic fertility.
Darwin must have gone wrong somewhere about man, and badly wrong. For if his theory or explanation of evolution were true, there would be in every species a constantly recurring struggle for life: a competition to survive and reproduce which is so severe that few of the competitors in any generation can win. But this prediction of the theory is not borne out by experience in the case of man. In no human society, whether savage or civilized, is there any such struggle for life.
[…]
You can try reminding the Darwinian, if you like, that this theory of evolution is a proposition about all species of organisms, at all times and places; and that man is a species, that the last three centuries are times, and that advanced countries are places.
Darwinists will say that welfare, employment benefits, and even health care disturb natural selection and, if removed, we will see more of the evolutionary model of the strongest reproducing along with the fight for survival. This “veneer” idea is debunked below, but even if you were to take it as valid, multiple societies that contain billion of people currently have welfare, employment benefits, and health care, all developed from the will and efforts of the human animal, naturally and progressively. In other words, to make evolution true, we’d have to manually and artificially intervene and remove all the altruistic fruits and layers of our society that have independently come forth in all corners of the planet. Can you imagine a physicist insisting on blowing up an errant planet that doesn’t obey the laws of gravity to make sure his theories remain universally true?
The reproductive urge to make babies is barely an urge
Your reproductive urge is so strong and so intense that you are wearing condoms, not ejaculating inside women to give them your seed, having panic attacks when a girl announces her period is late, and in the case of some men, dropping out from sex entirely for the evolutionary trivial reasons that women have unreasonable standards and bad attitudes.
A common argument by someone not fulfilling their evolutionary need is that they possess a lack of “resources,” but this can be laughed upon its face with a visit to an African village or South American slum where children living on a dollar a day make it to reproductive age and later go on to reproduce heartily themselves. In fact, the more you raise your children in impoverishment, the more likely they will have more kids and spread your genes than if you raised them in comfort and luxury. The “resources” argument is outright absurd if uttered in the West where the state will raise the kid for you and allow it to reach reproductive age without you spending a dollar.
Consider that I can have 100 children in Washington DC right now and all 100 will be properly clothed, fed, and cared for without me lifting a finger. None would die from neglect before reaching adulthood. Quick—go forth young man and place your seed within every woman you have sex with! Then escape the country and watch from afar as your seeds grow. I promise you the state will raise those seeds and that your genes will be passed on for the next hundred generations, and you will have done as much to live out your evolutionary destiny as the great Mongol kings. Isn’t that why you are here for?
But of course you will do no such thing, because there is only a trivial drive in you to reproduce, and if you fail to do it during your lifetime, you would not even shed a tear, and may actually be happier because of it. Based on Darwin’s theory, we should be jumping at the chance to use the altruism of others or the state to maximally reproduce, even if it still comes at detriment to ourselves, but we’re not, showing how absurd and false the “survive and reproduce” paradigm really is.
Human life is full of opportunities for reproduction which the supply of food would permit, but which are not taken in fact.
[…]
…our species practices, or has practiced, on an enormous scale, infanticide, artificial abortion, and the prevention of conception. No other species does anything at all of this kind, but we do, and we appear to have done so always.
[…]
"
http://www.rooshv.com/the-theory-of-evolution-does-not-apply-to-modern-human-beings,,"…women are hardly ever permitted to marry as soon as they are capable of reproduction. The result is, of course, that years of reproductive opportunities are very commonly neglected, however plentiful food may be.
Darwin also didn’t mention why the reproductive urge decreases when humans move from rural areas to cities. How can it be that bars, movie theaters, cafes, yoga studios, and sushi restaurants can diminish, delay, or outright halt a human being’s need to reproduce? Why do humans dedicate their lives—often during their most fertile years—to professions and careers and shallow social experiences in dense cities that hurt their ability to reproduce? It turns out that humans have this weird tendency, as civilization marches on, to develop specializations, activities, and gadgets that self-limit their reproduction or that of others, while at the same time becoming more energized at making money, accumulating possessions, having fun, and raising cute dogs and cats than having the maximum number of children they’re able to.
Humans do not reproduce up to the limit of the food supply
The Malthus-Darwin proposition, then, that population increases if food does, may be a truth, or a false but fertile near-truth, when it is applied to species other than Homo sapiens. But applied to our species, the best it can be is the following pure triviality: that population increases if food does, unless it is prevented from doing so by one or more of a dozen different causes that we know of, or by one or more of an indefinite number of causes that we do not know of.
[…]
The offspring of a most privileged class exhibit, in fact, more strongly than those of any other class, and far more strongly than the offspring of the poor, a proclivity towards a whole range of things, every one of which is more or less unfavorable to parenthood. To early sexual exhaustion, to sexual incapacity, to sexual indifference, to homosexuality, to religion, to study, to art, to connoisseurship, to gambling, to drunkenness, to drugs . . . To almost anything in the world, in fact, except increasing or even maintaining the numbers of their own class by reproduction.
It’s important to reiterate that Stove doesn’t disprove evolution, and leaves aside the fact that the theory can fit quite well for other organisms, but he gives too many examples to count on how evolution is not correct for explaining human reproduction and behavior. To find the greatest paradox to evolution, all you need is a mirror, since your own life goes against it, as does mine.
Here, for example, is a respected sociobiologist, Professor R. D. Alexander, writing in 1979: “. . . we are programed to use all our effort, and in fact to use our lives, in reproduction.” People who use all their effort, in fact use their lives, in reproduction: does that sound like anyone you know, or ever heard or read of?
[…]
It means that an impediment, however microscopic, to an organism’s maximal reproduction, if such an impediment ever occurred at all, would be completely eliminated by natural selection, and as quickly as such elimination can take place.
I know dozens of men personally who have had sex with over 100 women, but I do not know one who engages in purposeful reproduction, even though they are so easily able to. We are all “errors” of evolution, along with billions of other human beings.
Evolution requires high child mortality that is absent in humans
For the “strongest” to survive, the weak must continually die. Darwin suggested levels that can be interpreted as over 50%. But in human beings, nearly everyone survives, even the weakest, meaning that natural selection is no longer selecting for the strong, thanks in part to medical advances. If natural selection is not selecting, and not ensuring that only the strong pass on their genes, evolution is not occurring in humans.

…there will be in every species a severe struggle for life among conspecifics, and a high child mortality. And that is the very thing, of course, which is needed to ensure in turn that in every species there will be that natural selection which is, according to the Darwinian theory, the vera causa of evolution.

[…]

…[evolution] implies a struggle for life among humans which is far more severe, and a child mortality which is far higher, than any which really exists, or indeed could exist, consistently with our species surviving at all.

There is no “struggle for life”

If a man today really did believe we were engaged in a “struggle for life,” competing viciously for food and survival every moment of the day, he would be labeled mentally insane and instituted. Only in cases of starvation is any struggle seen, and yet even then humans will still act rationally and altruistically in times of crises, even to non-relatives, as you have seen in the news after natural disasters rip through tight-knit communities.

Considering that no modern Western citizen has seen starvation, or likely ever will, they’ll luckily escape Darwin’s all-encompassing theory for their entire lives. So while food is plentiful, and there is no struggle for life, what biological theory of life are we following? What is determining the progress of the species? It surely isn’t evolution by natural selection. A program of “everyone lives” and “everyone can reproduce if they want” is not what any Darwinist has proposed.

As for that “struggle for life” among conspecifics, supposedly universal and constant, which Darwin was later to make famous, he saw nothing of it among the Yahgans [indians]. Well, that should go without saying: there was none of it there. Collecting shellfish, their commonest form of food-getting, was done by family groups, or by individuals. In winter, when the guanaco, with a good layer of fat on them, were forced downhill by the deepening snow above, a group of men would go off for a few days to hunt them. Whatever they got was simply shared among the hunters, who carried home as much as they could to share with their families. Well, they would, wouldn’t they? Only someone who had “the struggle for life” on the brain would expect anything different.

[…]

…what would it be like, to meet a population of humans who really were always engaged in a Darwinian struggle for life? I cannot say. The best I can summon up is a very indistinct picture of a number of people in a sort of pandemonium competition for food. In my picture, the people are not distinguishable from one another by age, by sex, by rank, or by anything.

[…]

…if, on the other hand, your faith in Darwinism is so profound that you simply must have human beings, not only in the remote past but now too, always engaged in a struggle for life so severe that it leaves no room for altruism and exacts a child mortality of 8o percent or more: well, if you have made that uncomfortable bed, you will just have to lie in it. And one of its minor discomforts is this: that you will have to reconcile yourself to performing, all your life, that evasive trick of which Hume rightly complained. That is, of calling certain facts—namely the facts of human altruism—a “problem” or a “difficulty” for your theory, when anyone not utterly blinded by Darwinism can see that these facts are actually a demonstration of the falsity of your theory.

Altruism is an innate human trait

When evolutionists discuss altruism, they attempt to paint it as a “mistake” of evolution or strain mightily to somehow make it fit their theory, instead of just admitting that their theory is wrong. Altruism is indeed a pathological trait in humans, who are far from “selfish” beings constantly working in their self interests. Every single day you have a need to share, teach, help, and communicate, and not only to your relatives but also strangers, and the benefits you receive from this altruism doesn’t at all increase your ability to reproduce. In fact, I believe the need to have children is not only to pass on your genes, but to have ready-made targets to receive your overflowing and debilitating altruism.

Stove remarks how a human being or group spontaneously showing altruism would and should have been crushed by existing non-altruistic human groups. Since that did not happen, it suggests that altruism was likely with us from the first man.

…how, in a constant competition among conspecifics to survive and reproduce, altruistic individuals could possibly avoid being demographically “swamped” by non-altruistic ones.

[…]

There is no reason whatever, apart from the Darwinian theory of evolution, to believe that there ever was in our species an “evolution of altruism” out of a selfish “state of nature.” People believe there was, only because they accept Darwin’s theory, which says that there is always a struggle for life among conspecifics, whereas there is no such struggle observable among us now, but a great deal of observable altruism instead. The right conclusion to draw, of course, is that Darwin’s theory is false.

[…]

For Darwinian theory says that there is always a struggle for life going on among the members of every species. So why was not every tender shoot of altruism or morality always promptly sheared off by natural selection?

If you on an impulse make an altruistic “offer” to some of your non-altruistic conspecifics, they will—if words mean anything—close with your offer, and thereby improve their own chances of surviving and reproducing; but not yours. If you make a habit of this kind of thing, there is only one way matters can end for you, and for any offspring you may manage to leave who inherit your amiable disposition. Your lineage, far from becoming one of “the favored races in the struggle for life,” will quickly be extinguished.

If for over 100 years you incessantly teach people they have a selfish nature and act only in their best interests, you are surely enabling selfish behavior in humans, and yet in spite of this continuous brainwashing, altruism is still hugely present in all societies. If I had the ability, for over 100 years, through the media and academia, to state that mushrooms are the most vile food imaginable, I have no doubt that per capita consumption of mushrooms would decline.

The human need to communicate

Humans have an innate need for communication, for communication’s sake, among other needs that don’t improve their survival or reproduction.

…it is perfectly obvious that people do not now communicate, or communicate as much as they do, because of any advantage which accrues to themselves from communicating. Indeed, there are few human experiences more common than that of people finding that they have injured their own interests, by too great a readiness to communicate, or too great a receptivity to the communications of others. Yet lessons of this kind are constantly thrown away on us, simply because our love of communication is so strong, and so little controlled by a regard for our own interests.

[…]

…it can perfectly well happen, and often does happen, that a man pursues one or more of these “particular passions” without regard to his own interests; indeed, to the manifest injury of those interests, and even to the destruction of his wealth, health, or life itself. The man who, in defense of his "

The myth that human communication is selfish and deceptive
Another often-heard quote is that humans constantly manipulate and lie to achieve their ends, but such tactics can only work against a backdrop of honesty and truth telling, since lying is a parasitic behavior that needs the “clean” behavior to be effective. Therefore being honest is the original human state, while lying is the parasitic and more rare form of communication.
…it is not hard to see what the result would be, if in the future such manipulative communication were to become universal, or even nearly so. Communication, whether manipulative or otherwise, would then just die out altogether, for the simple reason that no hearer would ever know what any speaker meant by the words he uttered.
[…]
…human intelligence and consciousness plainly have a degree of autonomy which is wildly inconsistent with Darwinism. If intelligence and consciousness in humans are always subordinated, like all other adaptations of organisms, to their striving to increase, then The Origin of Species was an attempt by Darwin to increase the number of his descendants. But it was not.
[…]
Yet if what The Selfish Gene says is true, what else can that book be, but manipulation of its readers by the genes of Richard Dawkins, striving for their own maximal replication?
If “all” communication was deceptive, you would be confused as to what you’re even reading right now, and take an agonizing amount of time to process a single sentence.
The veneer idea is false
This idea, that civilization, morality, unselfishness and self-restraint, are only superficial and misleading appearances, disguising our selfish, savage, animal nature, I will call for short “the veneer idea.”
[…]
…if you intend to stick to the Darwinian theory, you simply have to say that, in the human case, most of the time, the struggle for life is going on below the surface of society: concealed by the veneer of unselfishness, considerateness, and so forth.
[…]
Darwinism and Freudianism are only variations on a common theme, and what that theme is. It is that such things as self-restraint, cooperation, and consideration for others are merely part of a thin disguise which society places over our selfish and non-moral animal nature.
[…]
Despite the widespread and longstanding acceptance that the veneer idea has enjoyed, and still enjoys, it is false, and even obviously false. For it compels us to ask a certain simple question, and yet cannot answer it: namely, whence the veneer? What could have brought such a thing into existence in the first place, or kept it in place if it had once come into existence?
[…]
If the members of every species are always engaged in a struggle for life with one another, and if human beings were selfish and non-moral animals at first, how could even the least little bit of morality or of altruism have escaped being eliminated by natural selection?
If evolution was in effect, it would have been impossible for the “veneer” of civilization to develop.
The myth of the evolutionary “savage”
“Cavemen” had rigid social and community roles, and weren’t allowed to do anything they pleased. A study of even modern tribes that exist today show they were more limited in their behavior in some ways than we are.
“Savages,” by contrast, have their behavior rigorously prescribed for them, at almost every moment of life, by gods or ancestors or elders or priests or chiefs, or at any rate by some external authority. And the more “savage” a tribe is, the more comprehensive and vice-like is the grip of social prescription on the lives of its members.
[…]
Human societies are almost inexhaustibly various, but there is one thing which no human (or even animal) society is even remotely like: namely, “savage” life, and civilized life below the veneer, as selfish theorists conceive it. They think of people as though they were the molecules of a confined volume of gas, which have no mutual sympathy, or any other influence, except by way of collisions with one another. This is the selfish theory to a T, as long as you impute to each molecule a ceaseless and exclusive regard to its own interests. The only thing wrong with this idea is that there is nothing whatever in reality which corresponds to it.
A quote you hear often is that “humans are one step in the jungle,” which is another form of the veneer idea in that civilization covers our true instincts, but even birds, when put in a starvation scenario, act more “selfish” and with more desperation to survive, yet they don’t have civilization, culture, or morality. There is no veneer specifically made for humans.
…what is stripped away from us under starvation or torture is not cultural, but biological. It is not the successive layers of convention, education, morality, etc. It is the successive layers of biological development which are natural to our species between infancy and mature adulthood.
Stove suggests that “savage” behavior is actually infantile behavior. When resources are low, adults regress back into panicked and teat-grappling infants in search of food.
Evolution is the last in a long line of “puppet master” theories
The stories of man can’t help but include a puppet master that is controlling all our behavior. Before it was god, now it’s genes.
“Our stars rule us,” says the astrologer. “Man is what he eats,” said Feuerbach. “We are what our infantile sexual experiences made us,” says the Freudian. “The individual counts for nothing, his class situation for everything,” says the Marxist. “We are what our socioeconomic circumstances make us,” says the social worker. “We are what Almighty God created us,” says the Christian theologian. There is simply no end of this kind of stuff. What is wrong with all such theories is this: That they deny, at least by implication, that human intentions, decisions, and efforts are among the causal agencies which are at work in the world.
Richard Dawkins has been especially successful in pushing the gene puppet master idea.
…writing in the full flood of conviction of human helplessness, [Dawkins] says that “we are … robot-vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes,”etc., etc. But at the same time, of course, he knows as well as the rest of us do, that there are often other causes at work, in us or around us, which are perfectly capable of counteracting genetic influences. In fact, he sometimes says so himself, and he even says that “we have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth.”” As you see, he is just like those writers of serial stories in boys’ magazines, who used to say, in order to extricate their hero from some impossible situation, “With one bound, Jack was free!”
[…]
…sensible people take no notice, when yet another crank or charlatan publishes yet another book which says that human beings are the helpless puppets of something or other: God, or God and demons, or History, or Race, or the Unconscious, or Aliens from Outer Space, or whatever. The Selfish Gene is simply another member of this slum breed of books, and ought to have been recognized as such from the start.
[…]
It is no mystery why the supply of puppetry theories never fails: there is an unfailing demand for them. People want relief from responsibility, and puppetry theories promise them this relief.
[…]
You could put [Dawkins] down anywhere in the world and rely on him to find there, what no one had before, invisible puppet masters manipulating visible puppets.
Atheists are quick to throw away god and angels as the main cause of human behavior, and then what do they do but simply replace them with genes as the main cause of human behavior. One must wonder at the curious human need to attribute their behavior to something invisible and all-powerful.
According to the Christian religion, human beings and all other created things exist for the greater glory of God; according to sociobiology, human beings and all other living things exist for the benefit of their genes.
[…]
Organisms have the adaptations that they do, according to the religion of Paley, because a single benevolent God intends them to survive and reproduce; and because that intention will be fulfilled the better, the better adapted the organisms are. According to the new religion, organisms have the adaptations they do, because many selfish gods intend to have copies of themselves, and as many copies as possible, carried by the next generation of organisms; and because that intention will be fulfilled the better, the better adapted the organisms.
[…]
Genetics has merely provided the new religionists with the precise locality of their gods, on the chromosomes of the sex cells.
Whether Darwin intended to or not, his theory swapped out one god for 30,000 powerful, purposeful, and apparently intelligent gods that control an individual human’s destiny. You are but a pathetic servant of these tiny genes.
Why is there evolution?
Where did it come from? What is driving it towards organization and consciousness? What is the reason for this process existing? Evolutionary theory does not answer this, and takes on the phenomenon of replication as an automatic given, like the existence of the Planck constant.
In particular, a molecule of DNA, or of water, or of anything, is not benefited by a replica of it brought into existence by this molecule itself, or by something else, or by nothing.

[Molecules] cannot delight in the number of replicas that they make of themselves. They are not even intelligent enough, after all, to know when they have made a replica of themselves.
Inclusive fitness is a flawed explanation to altruism
To solve the “altruism problem,” evolutionists came up with the idea of inclusive fitness, whereby you are likely to aid your relatives so that their genes can be passed, which contain identical copies of some of your genes. Stove makes the sarcastic comment that bacteria must then have extensive forms of altruism.
…what vast quantities of altruism must exist, between generations or between siblings, in all those species which reproduce either parthenogenically or by fission! For the members of these species share all their genes with their offspring or with their siblings.
[…]
Two sister bacteria, despite their genetic identity, will slug it out with each other for the means of subsistence, just like any other pair of good Darwinian girls.
[…]
A male robin red breast then, at least when defending a territory, cannot even tell the difference between a bit of red wool and a trespassing rival, even though a trespassing rival could quite easily be his brother. Yet the theory of inclusive fitness requires us to believe that he can tell the difference between his brother and a cousin, and again, between a cousin and an unrelated conspecific. Well, it is not logically, or even biologically, impossible.
[…]
…the theory of inclusive fitness still has the gaping puncture which it had at first. Namely, that it requires sibling altruism to be about as strong and common as parental, whereas in fact it is nothing of the kind. If so, we might as well admit that although, genetically, the sibling relation is “just as close” as the parent-offspring relation, biologically, it is nowhere near as close, at any rate as far as altruism is concerned.
We are puppets to genes that want their counterparts inside your relatives to reproduce, but this can’t even begin to work the way evolutionists propose unless you are told that you are a relative of someone, because the genes themselves don’t know what relation you have to a random man on the street. Genes are so stupid, in fact, that when newborn babies are accidentally switched in hospitals, the two unlucky sets of parents will altruistically raise the genes of another couple without any doubt it’s their own. Yet we’re supposed to believe that it’s these same genes that are working continuously to control you like a slave so that copies of them in you and your relatives can be allowed to replicate.
Evolution is like a buggy software program that needs constant patching as more “testing” reveals its obvious flaws. Instead of just doing away with the theory, scientists will create all sort of monstrous octopus legs and attach them to the theory, creating exceptions that even Darwin himself couldn’t have imagined.
Evolution blames nature for errors
People who believe in evolution victim-blame the organism when it acts outside the confines of evolution.
Contraception, homosexuality, natural celibacy, the love of truth or of beauty, accepting submission signals [in fighting], adopting children, and resenting baby snatchers: what a heavy catalogue of errors! It singles out our species as being the most hopelessly stupid of all the pupils in the great school of natural selection.
[…]
…scientific theory cannot possibly reprehend, in any way at all, any actual facts. It can explain them, predict them, describe them, but it cannot condemn them as errors. Astronomy cannot criticize certain arrangements of stars or planets as erroneous, and no more can biology criticize certain organisms, or characteristics of them, as erroneous.
[…]
Wherever Darwinism is in error, Darwinians simply call the organisms in question or their characteristics, an error! Wherever there is manifestly something wrong with their theory, they say that there is something wrong with the organisms.
[…]
Darwinians, rather than admit that their theory is simply not true of our species, brazenly shift the blame, and designate all of those characteristics “biological errors.”
Humans are an example of evolutionary farce
…far from every attribute being rigidly destroyed which is in the least degree injurious, in our species there is precious little except injurious attributes. Nearly everything about us, or at least nearly everything which distinguishes us from flies, fish, or rodents—all the way from practicing Abortion to studying Zoology—puts some impediment or other in the way of our having as many descendants as we could. From the point of view of Darwinism, just as from the point of view of Calvinism, there is no good in us, or none worth mentioning. We are a mere festering mass of biological errors.
[…]
Darwinism can tell you lots of truths about plants, flies, fish, etc., and interesting truths too, to the people who are interested in those things. But the case is altogether different, indeed reversed, where our own species is in question. If it is human life that you would most like to know about and to understand, then a very good library can be begun by leaving out Darwinism, from 1859 to the present hour.
Closing thoughts
As recently as three years ago I started noticing the flaws of evolution from self-examining my behavior and those of my hypersexual male peers, because you don’t pick up a book titled “Darwinian Fairytales” unless you already harbored serious doubts about the theory. I must admit that I made a mistake to use evolution as a reason to whore around with women when it was clear as day that I did not aim to reproduce. The behavior I did enact for so long can best be explained as entertainment seeking, relieving a lack of purpose in life, and wanting to feel masculine, but there was nothing evolutionary about it, and it has not at all increased my reproductive success than had I been an introverted 22-year-old and told my father to arrange a marriage for me with a girl from his Iranian hometown.
With this review I don’t aim to completely throw evolution under the bus, for it does apply quite nicely to other organisms, and natural selection has surely applied to humans during certain periods of their history, but it should not and can not be used to describe current human behavior, including your own, because any set of conditions that put humans through an evolutionary grinder are no longer present in modern civilization. Doing otherwise would be deception on a large scale, and I won’t deceive myself further by using it, even if it reduces scientific backing for some of my ideas.
Without using evolution as a tool, there is a big question that must be answered: where does traditional sex roles—and behavior—come from? Or more precisely: what are the correct sex roles for humans? The answer to the second is easier than the first. The correct sex roles are what has sustained human populations and society in the past and what will sustain human populations and society in the future. Biology need not be taken into account.
A careful study of history can clearly show what happens when men step outside of their traditional roles and what happens when women step outside of theirs, something spending ten minutes on Tumblr can verify. What are the sex roles and proper behavior of humans that allow a sustainable and mentally healthy population without ushering in the policies that would lead to a cultural collapse? The answer is the sex roles we already are familiar with, ones that have been known since Biblical times.
It’s a natural human urge to understand the “why” of how life came about, a question that was no doubt asked by the first man. The problem in answering with evolution is that—besides it being wrong—it locks your mind into a narrow perspective. Thinking that all humans act in genetic self interest clouds all your thoughts on human behavior and prevents you from seeing obvious contradictions and hidden truths. Because you have firm faith in evolution, you are not even allowing your mind to consider another viewpoint.
Say you encounter an article that says the following: “Men who go off to war have more children than men who don’t.” Evolution would describe this by saying that women want to reproduce with men who are most fit and strong and better able to defend the tribe. But let’s flip it and say “Men who don’t go off to war have more children than men who do.” Evolution can describe this too! It can say, “A superior reproductive strategy is to stay with the fertile women and reproduce with them during the time the alpha males are away.” Even the simplest of minds can find an explanation once it already knows the final result it’s aiming for.
If evolution can be used to explain both sides of the coin, which is often does, it’s not a scientific theory but a rationalization theory that justifies any and all human behavior as somehow fitting the theory. In other words, the theory is like playdough that can fit in any situation, and this is even done in the red pill portion of the manopshere to take any behavior a man or woman does and somehow justify it in terms of evolution, even if it’s based on people acting on the willful mission to not reproduce. What’s convenient for evolutionists is that none of their assertions can be proven, meaning that evolution is not more than one step above astrology in terms of describing or predicting human behavior. It’s gibberish.
Darwin’s theory came at the right time of history. The monarchy was overthrown and scientific rationalism dominated the day. The missing piece to complete the Enlightenment was a way to kill god, and Darwin came forth with a brilliant theory that did the job. The only problem is that it’s not true for humans, at least not in the way for other forms of life on earth.
There must be something else motivating and driving human beings that can’t be explained by current science, and so therefore the science we have is unable to provide a definitive and consistent account of our origin story along with our behavior. This means that if you are using evolution to structure, organize, or explain your own life, you are living a falsehood—a soothing falsehood but a falsehood nonetheless.
I must state that it’s not a comfortable position for me to neither believe in god or human evolution, for I have no working model for my own existence. It’s a weird place because my brain, for some reason, craves an origin story for where it came from. It’s searching, hunting, for something that explains how it got here, but I will be patient in this search, because I find it liberating and free that I no longer have to frame every human action through the lens of “survive and reproduce” and “all humans act in self-interest to spread their genes.”
Now that I have done this, it’s much easier to see how reproduction is not an important or essential human behavior and that evolution is nothing more than a severely flawed theory for explaining human beings.

Dover Area School District decision prohibiting the practice, creation science and intelligent design are still taught in far too many classrooms: perhaps more than one in eight, according to a 2011 survey. Outright denialism and overt teaching of non-science, however, is only part of the problem at the heart of America’s issue with evolution. Another part, which involves misconceptions about evolution, is far subtler. Such misconceptions have a variety of sources, but their effect, building up slowly over time, is to impair student understanding of evolution. As a result, the students are vulnerable to confusion and doubt about evolution in particular, or even science in general, after they leave school.
So what are some of the biggest misconceptions about evolution, how do you spot them, and what can you do about them? We’ll cover the first two in this installment, and three more in the next one.
In 2007, NOVA captured the emotional conflict over teaching evolution in public schools. Watch ""Intelligent Design on Trial"" steaming online here.
Misconception #1: Natural selection and evolution are the same thing.
Correction: Evolution, or descent with modification, describes any change in the distribution of heritable traits within a population over time. A mouthful, I know, but “change over time” is too simplistic—weather changes over time, but you wouldn’t say that weather evolves. Confusing and conflating scientific and common usage of terms, such as “evolve” or “adapt,” exacerbates many of the

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/education/2015/05/biggest-evolution-misconceptions-part-1/,1,"misconceptions I’ll discuss. An important lesson to impart to all students—and scientists, and science communicators, and, well, everyone—is the importance of context in understanding language. So evolution is heritable change in a population over time, but what is natural selection? Natural selection is one mechanism—a very important mechanism, but still just one—of evolution. Others include genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation.
What this misconception looks and sounds like: In the classroom, look for students interchanging the two concepts and terms as if they are synonymous. For example, “Evolution explains how the characteristics of populations change over time and occurs when the environment favors certain variations over others.”
genes2
Natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation are all mechanisms of evolution.
What to do about it: When covering evolution, be sure to emphasize that natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution. It could very well be the case (as in the Next Generation Science Standards) that your curriculum does not explicitly call for exploration of the other mechanisms, but that doesn’t mean you need to give students the impression that it’s natural selection or nothing. You can explain that there are other ways that evolution occurs, but in class, you’ll be focusing on one. If you get an answer along the lines of my hypothetical example, push back a little. Tell the student, “What 
"
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/education/2015/05/biggest-evolution-misconceptions-part-1/,1,"you’re describing is natural selection—remember! Evolution occurs in other ways, too.”
I expect, however, that you at least touch on the other mechanisms in your existing suite of evolution lessons. For example, if you go over the diversification of the finches in the Galápagos (and who doesn’t?), you cover not just natural selection but also genetic drift—even if you don’t identify it by name. Recent research has highlighted the role of gene flow in human evolution (your students will love talking about Neanderthal–Homo sapiens interbreeding!), and mutation, itself a mechanism of evolution, is a part of almost any evolution case study. The next misconception is a direct consequence of the last one.
Misconception #2: All traits are adaptive.
Correction: A lot of traits are adaptive—but definitely not all. If you want an example of a trait that isn’t adaptive, look no further than your own belly button. A belly button is a scar left from the umbilical cord connection that sustained development. The umbilical cord? Definitely an adaptation. Its scar? Not so much.
The belly button is an example of a non-adaptive byproduct, but there are other kids of non-adaptive traits, too. For example, tetrapods, such as humans, typically have five digits—why five? There is probably no good reason—it just happened that way. Fingers and toes are of course adaptive, but the specific number of them? Not so much.
"
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/education/2015/05/biggest-evolution-misconceptions-part-1/,1,"number of digits on a human hand can be used as an example of a non-adaptive trait.
What this misconception looks and sounds like: Look for students to ask what everything is for—it’s so easy when learning about such incredible adaptations as the proboscis of Darwin’s hawk moth to the color-changing ability of the octopus to think that everything is for something, so they’ll ask that question again and again. Also look for the inverse—the dread “X evolved for Y,” as in “feathers evolved for flight.”
What to do about it: The best way to make students see the fallacy of the hyperadaptive view of life is to point out clear examples of non-adaptive traits, so talk about belly buttons and male nipples! Provide examples to help students understand that adaptive functions can change (whale hip bones) and even be lost (human tail bones). Also, introduce an adaptation litmus test: To be an adaptation for a particular function, the trait must be heritable, have the function it was selected for, and increase fitness. Return to the litmus test again and again as you discuss everything from peacock tail feathers to dinosaur forearm feathers.
Help students understand the fallacy of “feathers evolved for flight” by exploring how feathers evolved over millions of years.
So evolution occurs via several mechanisms and not all traits are adaptive. This may somehow feel like a de-emphasis of natural selection, and in a way it is—but it is not a de-emphasis of evolution. Cracking down on these misconceptions, and the ones I’ll discuss in the next part of this post, will give your students a more sophisticated understanding of evolution, and by extension, a more sophisticated understanding of the world around them.
